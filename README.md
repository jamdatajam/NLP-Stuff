# NLP-Stuff
	This repository contains a few of the projects I've done on NLP (Natual Language Processing) in Python/Jupyter Notebook.
	- Spam_Detector_Comparison (2018) is a simple NLP classifier that compares the accuracy of Naive Bayes to AdaBoost using word count ratios (preprocessed).
	- Sentiment analyzer using NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit), BeautifulSoup, and Logistic Regression to classify Yelp reviews into positive comments and negative comments based on the words the reviews contain.
