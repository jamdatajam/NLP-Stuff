First of all why do you want a power UPS? There are some very good reasons. (1) You never want your machine to go down incorrectly because of a blackout. (2) You want to work with clean power only. (3) You want to monitor your PC power. (4) You want to prevent your PC from being damaged due to a power problem like a lighting strike and want surge protection. The first rule about UPS is to never trust the insurance claim. Get your PC insured elsewhere. These companies have a tendency not to support their insurance claims. I have a PC running some very high specifications with over six USB devices, LCD monitor, printer and Ethernet equipment, with everything on at the same time. I have never gone above 325W of usage and average between 250W and 300W when managing a high spec game and doing lots of background tasks. Even though I have a 400W Power Supply Unit (PSU) I will be upgrading to a 500W PSU because it is better quality model. The way I can monitor how many Watts I use is with UPS software and hardware. So the question you need to ask is how many watts you will be using. The short answer to this is you don't know until you install the UPS and software that tells you how many watts you use because that appears to be the only way you can monitor your wattage at this time. You need to estimate what it is. I would say a high-end domestic PC (not a server) would use 300W max if it has one of every device you can think off turned on. As soon as we add things like another PC, or several printers, or several monitors, then we can start to overload a 325W UPS. This brings us to the first thing we need to learn about any UPS - Overloading and balancing. The overload feature is a warning system that turns on when you have overloaded the UPS capacity. Overloading does two things. It can in theory eventually damage the UPS and it voids the warranty. Most UPS are 325W but there are 800W - 1000W and even greater models out there for home networks that use more than one PC setup but to be honest you are probably going to get a UPS per PC setup rather than expensive bigger UPS for a network. So check the UPS rating. What UPS you choose depends on how much you want to load on it. Next thing you need to check with the UPS is if it comes with a USB connection. If it does this is a big plus because it means you can control it from your PC and the UPS comes with software. Now if the UPS has this feature then you can do loads of stuff like turning off UPS sound alarms, controlling how your UPS handles a blackout, how long it uses the battery before shutdown or hibernation, if it sounds an alarm or not, if it run self tests, data collection and monitoring, notifications and sensitivity settings. If the UPS does not come with a USB connection and software then you probably should be looking for an UPS designed for computer use rather than a UPS for non-computer equipment. Most UPS have LED indicators that tell you the status of the unit. The next thing to understand is that testing your UPS is not done by breaking it out of the box, connecting it to the mains, plugging your PC in and then turning off the house's power with the circuit breaker. You must charge the UPS first! So read the instructions. Usually you must attach the battery to the UPS (plug it in firmly!) and wait before using it. Then perform the test using the software first! Then you can consider trying to simulate a blackout in your home to see if the PC stays up. Usually a UPS is programmed to shutdown your PC if the blackout lasts for a few seconds. Nearly all UPS models with a USB connection can be customized for the shutdown event or how long the PC should hold for on the UPS battery. Most UPS devices allow you to connect a modem phone line into the device and then run a phone line into your modem. This is important because power surges on a UPS that do not have this protection can damage a PC through the unprotected phone line running into the modem that usually runs to the PC somehow. This is nasty problem with the degree of security that a UPS can provide. If it doesn't have this function then it is not going to provide 100% surge protection with a PC that is on-line. Networking a UPS PC to another PC without UPS can also increase the risk of surge protection problems. It is not recommend that you network a UPS PC to a non-UPS PC unless surge protection and the warranty are not an issue. One last thing is that some UPS have input regions on the UPS for surge protection and other input regions are not surge protected. Also with some models the batteries need to be replaced after a few years if you end up using them a lot. This is everything you need to know about an UPS before you choose one. It is basically now about downloading the technical specs of the UPS and making sure it provides you with what you need. The two top brands are APC and Belkin

We bought this to backup the iMac G5 that I got my wife for Christmas. I have had an APC since 1996 and have depended on it to keep my systems running smoothly with the typical voltage fluctuations that we have in our area.

The overall product is very well designed and is a good value for the money.

I'm not sure if the Powerchute software was updated to run on Mac Tiger, howvever, so I did not install it.

It's unfortunate that an earlier review indicated that the unit had a serious flaw -- beeps whenever there is a problem with the incoming power.  This person obviously didn't take any time to familiarize himself with the software that controls the UPS.  The notification sounds can be completely turned off with the software.

I agree that I was annoyed when the unit made a loud beep in the middle of the night when there was a power problem.  Luckily, it was easy to turn this feature off.

Five stars for this product, for sure.

I replaced an older APC uninterruptible power supply with this one. I like the power bar design which makes it easy to use. It includes software to shut down your computer if the backup power gets low, and software so that you can choose not to get an alarm if the power goes out in the middle of the night. It has enough backup power to give my tower and monitor over 20 minutes of power if the wall power goes out. One tip; if you have a spare backup outlet, plug your electronic phone in. That way you won't be disconnected if there's a momentary power outage.

I already knew how good this product was before we bought it.  We had purchased one for my daughter and when lightening stuck it took out the surge protector and saved the computer.  I have recently learned I might have been able to have that replaced if I had thought to follow up.  But I was just so thrilled to have only lost an $80.00 (at that time) product and not a $1,200 computer.  When ordering mine, the price had come down quite a bit since we had first purchased one, I got free shipping, I never even had to leave the house!  I couldn't be happier!!

Electricity in my apartment would randomly go out for a couple of seconds every few weeks, usually at night, but i would find that my servers had a harsh shutdown and rebooted the next day. Very frustrating and i would lose some unsaved work. This backup battery  takes care of that problem very well. It comes with windows client software that monitors the state of the battery and logs any power events. The software isnt of the best design but it works. No linux software but it can still be used without it. The unit has 6 power outlets but only 3 are powered by the battery. I have 2 servers and a router hooked up to it

I have three of these CD towers, and in general I'm very pleased with them.  I like the wave design, and they hold a LOT of CDs.  I don't mind having to take off a whole stack of CDs to get to the one on the bottom, and as long as you balance the distribution of CDs properly, they don't tip that easily.  I always place mine next to a wall, anyway.  My biggest problem is that they are sometimes very difficult to put together.  Of course, that is only a temporary issue, although an incredibly vexing one.

I've had my Wave CD storage rack for almost 5 years now and I'm more than happy with it. It's been moved around, bumped and wedged between pieces of furniture, yet it has held on quiet nicely. I was originally attracted to it's wavey design which for me, is more artwork than just another storage case. I plan to buy another one

This product is a great deal.  The problem with its shakiness can be easily solved with a little imagination.  Get two standard sized bricks and place them at the bottom of each of the two metal spires (they fit perfectly). Friends will compliment you on your post-modern taste and sense of design as well!  They will use up about 10 CD's worth of space but then you still have storage for about 100 standard cd-cases or 200 thin ones.

as someone else mentioned its not the sturdiest rack out there, but it has not tipped over on me so i really cant complain.
it looks good, and its easily put together. 

as for the sturdy issue, i look at it like this. since when do you place cd racks in the middle of the room?? NEVER!! 
people will typically place them in the corner of a room which is fine and you will NEVER have an issue with the rack at all. i have mine set right near the entrance of the bedroom door and i have brushed up against it and bumped elbows with it, and it ever so slightly moved a little but nothing where i was worried about it falling. oh and i have carpet in my room which makes it for a less sturdy foundation. 
i have even thought about purchasing another one for dvd's.

personally speaking i def recommmend this cd rack

I have never had this device fall over like others have complained of, either.  Granted, I do have mine situated one a hard wood floor but even so - it seems sturdy enough.

It is a little irritating with the wave structure how some of CDs won't fit but other than that I find this tower really helpful.  It's a nice and fun way to store your CDs

The first time I saw this piece was at Wal-mart. I had listened to Sony,Philips, JVC, Panasonic, RCA in that order, the difference was instantly clear. Then I went back to listen to the Philips again and the difference was clear.I recommend that first time buyers should go to a store with several brands on display that they could listen to. I made up my mind that if  I wanted a home theater in a box (HTIB)package it will be the Philips brand.This was about 10 months ago. Each time I stopped by the electronic section of any store I would check it out. Finally, I decided to buy one. Next thing was to read expert reviews and consumer reviews. Most reviews rated it high. However, I was concerned about the hissing sound some consumers had experienced.I still went ahead to buy one at Fred Meyer for $179:00 on sale, if I did not like it, I will return it, I reasoned. I bought the black colored piece. Costco and Radioshack had it on sale for the same price but Fred Meyer is closer to my home. 
Since adding this piece to our family room, the audio effects in our family room is certainly more welcoming, warmer , richer and entertaining than before.
 I will address the concerns of a few reviews here.
1. Hissing sound: I found none, but discovered that if the audio OUT on your TV has one jacket like mine, instead of two or three jackets, then you need to get an extension RCA jacket that will split your one outlet to two or three OUT jackets with the apporpriate color codes (white, red (for two jackets) and yellow for the third jacket) to match the audio IN jacket (white and red) of the DVD player, otherwise you will get either a humming or hissing sound. Please note that the key here is to have the color codes on your TV audio OUT,to match the color codes on your Philips DVD  audio IN otherwise you will get a humming or hissing sound.

2. DVD player jumping disc: You are using a defective disc. solution: change your disc.

3. Back speakers not working: They will not work if you do not use the remote control to adjust the surround and sound buttons to the appropriate mode e.g. movie , stereo etc. Sometimes, some movies are not recorded to produce surround sound effect, so change the TV channel or your DVD disc.

4. Speaker wires not long enough:Some consumers had enough length, mine were too short for our large family room (too large for me to bother to measure). One reviewer was able to use banana plugs to make the adaptation,I could not. So I returned the banana plugs, I bought from Home depot. Instead, I  bought some digital extension cables. They come in different sizes 14G,16G,18G,20G etc. The smaller the size number, the thicker the cable, the better, to avoid loss of digital signals. I bought size 14G. The risk with attaching extension cables is that since you will have to cut into the original cables that come with the equipment you can not return your equipment to the store nor sell it at ebay for a good price if you wanted to,since it will be considered tampered with. But be reassured you will not need to dispose of this equipment once you have it properly set up.If you decide to use additional extension cable/wire, cut the orginal wire at about 6 inches from the speakers. Attach your extention cable to this cut end and run the attached extension cable from your speaker location to where your equipment is.Then attach the other end of your extension cable to the other end of the original cable, so you can still use the proprietary speaker plugs that came with your equipment to attach to the back of the set.This method makes it cosmetically suitable to have one cable (i.e. the extension) run through your entire room and at the same time use the the proprietary plugs attached to the orginal cable at the other end with your equipment, which by the way is the only plug that fits into the jackets at the back of the DVD player/receiver.REMEMBER to tape over all exposed wires/cables with nonconductive electric tape. Normally, comes in black.
Caution: you need to buy enough length of extension cable though, they come in 25ft, 50ft and 100ft length. Having a large room I bought three 50 feet cables to do the job satisfactorily.The cost for each 50 ft cable was $19:00.



5. Wall mountings:The enclosed wall mountings are fixed. You can not rotate the position of your speakers once mounted. For less than $15:00 at Wal-mart , I bought a set of 5 speakers wall mounts that I can rotate from side to side or move up and down to a suitable head angle.

Speaking of the sound production, it is clear, crisp and true theater realism. The sonics can not be described justily unless you hear it for your self.Do your self a favor and buy one.

But for the proprietary plugs that make it difficult to consider using extension cables , I would have given it 5 stars. Philips should make the plugs universally adaptable, so consumers wil not have second thoughts about adding extension cables, if they needed to. Better still, Philips could add more length to the cables or make provisions for one to order fitting extension cables through them so you do not have to cut into the original cables.

I had read some other reviews stating that this Home Theater System makes a buzzing noise.  However, I had my doubts so I ordered it anyway and it's great.  No buzzing noise on mine at all.  I have an apartment and didn't really want to spend a whole lot of coin on a major system that I couldn't really use anyway because of noise restrictions.  This system is nice and clear and gives me the Home Theater Experience I was looking for.  They give you plenty of wire to run along the edge of a room and still have enough slack to hang the rear speakers up behind the couch on the wall.  Granted the speaker wire isn't all that thick, and has a proprietary male/female connector into the unit which would make upgrading to monster cable a pain.  It still sounds great and for under $200 bucks why would you care anyway.

We own the HTS3400 bought at Costco.  It is possible that the newer "D" model has fixed the hissing we hear during stand-by mode.  We have owned it about a year now and I believe it is getting louder.  When the house is quiet I can hear it in the next room.  It doesn't bother my wife; she finds it restful.  I don't like it because I don't think it should be making any sound at all.  Given the choice I would NOT buy this product again

I bought this system recently after my Panasonic DVD Surround System broke. I was a little leary about this system since other reviewers have mentioned a hissing noise here on Amazon and other sites for that matter. But I couldn't find anything like this value and decided I could just take it back if I didn't like it. Well, I love it! The sound is great! Subwoofer is awesome! I do not hear a hissing noise at all. This sounds so much better than my Panasonic which broke and that I had paid $100 more for

Costco here too. 180 was a great price, but the hissing has become annoying. It does sound like a larger capacitor....its constant...constant. i hear it walking through the room passing within 8-10 feet of the unit. the noise dissapears when tray is open, only. i really like it, but the hiss is getting to me. I notice its on sale here for $129. Maybe ill shop around, spend a bit more

Just a note to those who've been having trouble opening these cases, without breaking them. If you use an emory board to slightly sand the top knob which is holding the case together, you'll be able to open and close it ok. Don't sand too much, and just do the top knob, or it won't hold together. I like the fact that these cases are clear and fairly inexpensive, so I wanted to make them work. Hope it works for you

I wish they had a rating for zero stars.  I bought the fifty pack and had 12 good burns and 38 coasters.  That's a 24% success rate.  I subsequently bought verbatim data life and have burned 14 so far with no coasters.  Memorex has really gone downhill.

I have used these DVD+Rs for over two years now and they work absolutely great. I have burned movies, games, files, everything. Haven't had a single coaster yet and the movies worked in all the DVD players I tried them out on.

I just finished a 25 package of the Memorex 4.7GB 4x DVD +R Media and have reordered a 50 pack and 25 pack. All my DVD burns were successful. I am using a Sony DVD drive and have been burning my home video creations at 4x with MYDVD software that came with the drive. I have a Kenwood DVD player downstairs and a Sony DVD player upstairs. It plays on both, plus I have made copies for friends with all positive feedback. I highly recommend these discs.

  I'm afraid I have to agree with the other previously happy Memorex users in noting that Memorex quality/success rate has gone downhill.  I was skeptical when I read the other reviews and I stuck with Memorex, but I have seen the light now. For a year I was very successful with the DVD+R Memorex disks.  In the 25 pack spindles I would buy, they would all work....so in Aug '04 I bought 2 25 packs at Circuit City (a mistake?).   That appears to have been a waste of money.  I just tried to burn a copy of something and I ended up trashing 4 disks in a row.  I was  convincing myself it was my hardware or program or something else.  Then I remembered someone had given me a blank Sony DVD-R disk, so I thought what the heck, let me try that one.    Into the SONY drive it went and it copied without a hitch.   That was the final straw for my Memorex loyalty.  Out of a pack of 25, I have about 10 left, but have had to trash 6 of the 15 I used. Not a good success ratio.  Bye Memorex

I just burned my first home video DVD on the Memorex DVD+R disc.
It worked the first time!  I have a TDK Burner installed in my Dell computer.  The resulting disc works on my wife's Gateway laptop with DVD and also my Pioneer home DVD player.
So far so good...no coasters.

I've previously purchased Memorex media DVD+R and have not had any problems until recently. My latest purchase has given me infinitely more grief and frustration than the initial purchase price... Where do I start, how about the fact that the media is labeled as 4X and only burns at 2.4X (gray spindle)? How about the fact that files and videos have errors causing file corruption and/or video dropouts (stutter or DVD lock-up)?. I thought it was my recorder until I read all the reviews... There has been a HUGE drop in quality recently. If you want to gamble with the recent sub-par quality of the Memorex branded media and "hope" every thing turns out ok by all means make your purchase here. For me, I'm dumping more than 50% remaining on the spindle because the media is completely unreliable and worthless for anything other than coasters

I have nothing to compare them to, but I bought 3 of these and they seem to do the job they are intended to do.  I was surprised to see no savings on shipping when I ordered 3 vs ordering 1 at a time, although I am now clear on the policy.  They still were a bargain, as far as I have compared.  I would buy again, from the same vendor

This once available product has served me well.

Very dynamic, universal in use, and user friendly. What more could be asked of a simple battery backup system that doesn't cost hundreds of $.

I'm looking for the replacement because it's best duty is under every critical user's computer

I used this reader for a week before it stopped working. It worked OK for the week that it worked at all. It would not read xD cards though. It did not detect that a card was inserted at all. I tried inserting the card fully, partially and even tried jiggling it a little. It seemed like the contacts on the card were touching the contacts on the reader but it would not recognize that a card was inserted. It did, however, work with my compact flash card. Then, inexplicably, it stopped functioning entirely. I unplugged it and plugged it back in and scanned for hardware changes in Device Manager but the card was dead. I tried plugging it into another computer and it was not detected at all.  Lexar support left a lot to be desired. I explained the problem in detail and the response I got was a generic "Try restarting the computer, etc, etc." Then, they wanted me to pay for shipping to RMA their defective merchandise. I sent it back to Amazon instead and got my money back. I'm willing to assume that I just got a lemon, but the piss poor tech support convinced me to get a  refund rather than a replacement.

I recently received this as a Christmas gift, and it didn't work from the start. After much time wasted with their "tech support" the device was deemed defective. Their tech support is very poor - all they could say, "try another Xd card". The device kept freezing my system, the driver that came with the software didn't work, a very frustrating experience. If the tech support was more informative or supportive, Lexar might have redeemed itself. I recently purchased the Sandisk 5 in 1 reader and it works like a charm, right from the start. Their quick start guide is much more detailed, and their software works! Save yourself a headache and buy Sandisk

The Lexar Media 2.0 cannot function smoothly with a one gigabyte card from Olympus. The help site explains how, with my Mac, I can reboot my computer in OS 9 Classic then, download the pictures, then reboot in OS X. Not a satisfactory solution. I felt screwed on discovering this after the purchase. I feel like I simply acquired electronic junk. There was no response from Lexar when I emailed support, which simply added to my feeling of being had

My biggest concern when looking for a card reader was that it work on my Win98 (not SE) machine.  Ive only used it with Compact Flash but it reads and writes several brands and capacities just fine.  No install problems either, even though the machine/OS is pretty old.

The "pop down" door is a little goofy, but I just stick a pencil in the door to keep it from closing.  This props it up on the desk so it is a bit easier to get the cards in and out

Compact, portable and works with all the popular media cards: cf I/II, sm/mmc, sd/xd and mms/mmsp. I have one at home and one at the office, both you can take anywhere and doesn't take up alot of space. Easy to use, plug & play. Nice cover opens up and keeps the slots clean from dust when closed. The lid opens and acts as a stand for the reader, a nice angle for putting in the cards.

I got mine for less than $10.00, so it's definitely worth it! Lexar has great quality and good design. Highly recommended

The walkman is easy to use with enough memory for my meager uses.  The sound is excellent, but I use an older set of Sony head phones rather then the ear pieces that came with the set.

The unit recharges very quickly and again for my uses last a long time.

It is quite small and the only disadvantage I've found is there is no clip or arrangement to carry it except a pocket

First off let me state for the record that I only buy Sony , but I have to
advise you against the purchase of the bean walkman. I purchased one in March 2006 and returned it September 2006, as I had purchased replacement
insurance and was able to return it because it broke. It is hard to turn off and the usb port cover always pops open, not to mention the headphones
always pull out. The FM receiver is hard tune in the daylight as the screen is invisiable. Save your self the hassel!!!!!

I just ordered the second one for our family.  It's the 3rd Sony MP3 player to join our househould.  They've been very dependable, and they're easy to use.  The software is simple.  The sound is great, and the batteries hold a charge for an incredible amount of time.  My teenagers (girls) love that they come in colors, and they're different than what most of their friends have.  Mom loves that they're affordable

This is the greatest little MP3 player!!! The sound is great (good bass), the size is very convenient and everybody who see it, wants one. It fits in a pocket, has an armband option or a key ring option, even little speakers as an option. I've taken it on so many trips. There is a caution though, even though the software is good for Windows Plus or better, you can not download from the web unless you have Windows XP

Hardware awesome, software a flop. Since you HAVE to use their software the package is destroyed. I will give you the final nail on the coffin for me. I tried to put Podcasts on the device using the latest SonicStage 4. No chance. It wants to be able to find each "artist" in the Sony library. This was bad for the odd bit of music it could not find but obviously it can not find the podcasts in their library.

I had bought one of these and had considered one for the girlfriend - no chance now. Shame as the hardware was A1

This is my first portable mp3 player and it took me about an hour to go from taking it out the box to having music on it and for me to learn how to work the controls. I did have to read the manual for a few minutes to understand what "hold" meant on the screen - but other than that - very nice little product, good price, and very easy to use

 Well, to begin with, I am a complete iPOD hater. The whole idea of wasting an buttload of money on something with limited features doesn't sit right with me. But after robbing my bro of his for so long, since I had none, it was time to get something of my own. I chose this Walkman Bean player. The size is sick! Fits between a few fingers. Also, it is Sony, a trusted company, unlike Apple who will give you the runaround. The navigation and menu is so simple. I didn't read the manual and I figured it out. The only thing I read the manual for was to figue how to change the station on the radio, but that is negligible. Anyhow, I looooove it. Great bargain, sound investment

I had all the same rebate issues with this item as others, so if you are buying this CD case just because of the rebate, please DON'T.  I did finally receive my rebate, 4 months later after a second mailing in and irate email.  I just cashed the check and I'm crossing my fingers that it actually goes through!  The product itself seems okay.  I can see if you use it a lot that the zipper might break, but I rarely get into my CDs so I haven't had that issue yet.  However, I do not plan to ever buy from this company again because of all the rebate run around.  A very dishonest company if you ask me.  Good luck to everyone else waiting for a rebate

In theory an excellent product -- room for lots of disks, relatively compact and attractive HOWEVER I purchased three of these (2 for me 1 for a friend) I can't say how his is doing but both of mine have faulty zippers, making  it impossible to close the binders and therefore losing much of their attractiveness and compactness.

I also bought this item.  Sent in all of the required documents, including original UPC.  Rebate denied because UPC was not included.  I emailed them 3 times stating that I did in fact enclose it .  Also quoted the number from the copy of it that I retained.  To date, have heard nothing from them.  I have now filed a complaint with the Texas Attorney General, and will follow up and file with the better business bureau and the FTC.

I am sure this product works wonderfully with most devices, however, with my Panasonic SV-SD80 MP3 player, this product was not compatible.  I could still transfer files to it but it could not be formatted to SD Audio support

With my five megapixel Leica Digilux 2, this Lexar one gigabyte SD card will give me 244 color photographs at the highest-quality jpeg setting! That's equivalent to ten rolls of 35mm film. The write time is (to me) quite fast, so it really performs. So far, I have not encountered any problems with this SD card. And if it stays that way, I'll get another one.

If you snap shots in burst mode, or if you want to take pictures at sporting events, fast cards like those are the way to go.
Almost no lag, large capacity, lifetime warranty, no complaints

How many pictures will it store?

 How many pictures will it store?  It is the most commonly asked question from digital camera enthusiast but usually the question that is the most difficult to get a straight answer about.  Well, considering I worked in the memory industry for over 7 years I can help clarify this perplexing question and do so unbiased as I have since changed industries.  

The Lexar Media 1GB SD Card SD1GB -32-231, like most 1000MB cards, will store on average 1137 pictures when used with a 2 megapixel camera, 853 images when used with a 3 megapixel camera,  512 pictures when used with a 4 megapixel camera, 409 images when used with a 5 megapixel camera, and 320 pictures when used with a 6 megapixel camera.  These numbers are based off the assumption that you are going to shoot your images at the highest quality JPEG setting available for the camera and understand that they are estimates and may be off by as much as 10 percent due to numerous factors including the complexity of the scene being shot and the compression algorithm used by your specific camera.

One last thing to consider when buying a 1000MB card.  Do not necessarily choose the least expensive card available.  A 1000MB card should be an investment.  You need to consider quality, reliability, and speed with a card of this capacity.  Worse case scenario would be you taking this card (and only this card) on vacation with you overseas and for some reason it gets corrupted.  Then what do you do?  Purchasing a high capacity card changes the game a little, just be mindful of that before you hit the buy button.

I truly hope this review was helpful to you in determining whether this card is the right capacity for your specific needs

Works well, especially for anyone who still has their old console systems in use. I have my NES and SNES, both of which have huge AC adapters, plugged into this. It saves tons of space on my power strip.

The design is a little clumsy though, so it's only getting 4/5

I have had this controller for just about two years and have had no technical issues with it at all. I never installed any software for it, I simply plugged it in and it has worked flawlessly ever since. It may lack the frills of a more expensive controller, but I am very pleased with its toughness. Until there is a game pad for the PC that can accomplish this level of quality while including all the other bells and whistles, I'll stick with the durability feature instead

I installed this controller on winXP.  While I was playing an emulated game I noticed that my keyboard didn't work and there was no way to exit out of the game (alt+enter) to minimize the screen.  So i reset the computer and now the keyboard doesn't work at all, must be something to do with that installation CD.  I recommend before installing this controller to follow the instructions in the users manual, on creating a restore point, that you can go back to, incase something like this happens

I got this for my baby's room.  I was worried about the sound quality as per the other reviews, but it's quite good (though I don't have the ear of an audiophile).  The bass is pretty powerful & the treble is good as well.  There is a equalizer with 4 presets which works effectively as well.

The room is about 10'x11' and this stereo has more than enough capacity for this room.

MP3 cd's appear to work effectively.  Panasonic has generally had good MP3 cd support (subdirectories are supported).

I'm very pleased

It's amazing how tough it is to find boomboxes that have CD players capable of playing MP3 CD's - apparently, the industry has decided that most people don't want this feature in their CD boombox (they must assume people get their MP3 fix from iPods and similar devices).  But for those of us who've not yet shelled out a few hundred dollars for the latest iPod (I think the latest version is down to a quantum-level size device), this is a solid player for that purpose.  And the cassette player/recorder is also handy if you want to tape from your MP3 CD (or any CD, or the radio) for the benefit of those you may know who still haven't gone to CD yet (there are still a few of those out there as well).  Generally, this is a good product, though there are a couple of drawbacks.

First, the remote control apparently does not work when the boombox is running purely on batteries.  This seems kind of silly given that remotes aren't exactly power hogs.  Now, this could simply be a quirk of mine, and may not be a feature of the product overall, but I really didn't feel like dealing with the hassle of shipping it back and getting another one, so I've decided to live with this (it's not often it'll be on pure battery mode).

The other minor complaint is that it's not possible to fast-forward within an MP3 track when playing an MP3 CD (regular CD's can fastforward within a track).  Not sure why it doesn't, since every other MP3 CD player I've come across does (discman, car MP3 CD player, etc.), but it's not enough of a complaint to discourage picking one up in my view.

The sound equalizer is very minimal, but truthfully I wasn't picking this up so that everything would sound like a stadium rock concert to a jazz club to a concert hall, and things in-between.  I found no problem with the modes available, and find that this is doing the job I needed it to do just fine

The FM tuner would not bring in a clear station without interference from nearby stations.  The radio part, hence, was worthless.  The speakers are sub standard, no depth.  Without the remote, little can be done.  All in all, it is not worth trying.  My cheap 20 year old Sony boombox is of much higher quality

Just bought mine last week and just like many other consumers, I was searching for CD-MP3-AM-FM RADIO and remote. 
ADVANTAGES ARE: 
1) The ONLY smaller desktop unit that I found with CD-MP3-AM-FM RADIO and remote. 
2) Has sleep timer 30 minutes, 60 minutes, 90 and 120 minutes. This is handy for CD's, MP3's and the radio. 
3) Fairly good sound for the money.
4) Easy to use remote. (I leave mine next to the unit).
DISADVANTAGES ARE:
1) Earphone plug in the back of the unit. When I want to plug in my earphone, it is hard to reach this and it is a poor design!
2) My biggest disappointment--no resume on CD or MP3! I listen to alot of audio books and I find this a real inconveince! I have to go to the track that I think I left off or write it down! (My Panasonic MP3 CD small portable has this, why did they forget this in this one?). 
3) Terrible reception on AM--STATIC!
4) Sound equalizer needs much improvement for the sound quality and ease of use.
I bought this because it is the only AM/FM/CD/MP3/CASSETTE unit with a timer and remote that I could find! Since the AM radio is so terrible, I ended up buying the Sony ICF-M410V so I can listen to my AM talk shows. This one has a sleep timer up to 60 minutes, a clock and easy to use.
Overall, I still give it a 4 because of it's many features and that it has a cassette for my older tapes. **And, I wish I would have bought it on Amazon, not at Radio Shack (they were about $25 more). Live and learn! If you are looking for a all in one with CD, MP3, CASSETTE, REMOTE AND AM-FM RADIO, this is about the only one that you will find and I looked for 3 months!
UPDATE: September 18, 2006: After owning this one month, I like it better and better! I love the SLEEP feature that you can use up to 120 minutes (2 hours) either on the radio or the CD! This AUTOMATICALLY shuts the unit off. It is a great feature if you are listening to a CD that contains 40 hours of MP3's on it and you don't want it to play all night

I purchased this Boombox over a year and a half ago.  What I do like about is that it was hard to find a boombox with a remote and Mp3 playback.  I agree that it could have been better.  It would be nice to be able to rewind from the first to the last.  You cannot rewind/fast forward in the song in Mp3 format but you can do it with a regular audio cd. sometimes I like to hear a certain portion of a song again, but I will have to play the entire song again. I no longer have the remote and there are some things that I cannot do anymore.

I`m very Dissapointed with this boombox. The FM tuner has too much interference The FM is fine if you listen to a strong station but If you tune to a weaker station and your close to a downtown area you will hear 4 or 5 strong stations bleeding through the weaker ones. I`ve tried ajusting the coils but this model has no ajustments for FM only AM the AM has bleed too so if you try to pick up distant stations at night you may hear the strong station next to it. For example I live in Atlanta GA so the strongest AM signal is 750 WSB so if I try to tune into 780 WBBM at night I get 750 bleeding through I have had other Panasonic boomboxes that don`t have this trouble with AM. So If you listen to the radio like I do please check it out you`ll see what I mean. I hope Panasonic will correct this on future model

The pro and cons described by other reviews are valid. I was specifically looking for a boombox that has cassette, mp3, cd and radio capability. So didn't have much of an option but to get this one. I am impressed with the sound quality but agree that there could have been improvements related to interface and some of the functionality. Overall I think its a good buy.

Not as easy to use as a larger Panasonic I used to own but
otherwise fine. Good sound.  Using CD player and radio.
Buying via Amazon as usual is super

I was kinda concerned in regards to the price of the book stand, and from the pics it looked like it was a flimsy piece of plastic, but when I received it in the mail the book stand actually is a handy piece of work.  Holds my heavy hard bound books just nicely.  It does come with book page holders, but I don't really use them

So I was looking for a frim book holder that could support large books with up to 800 pages... could not find a nice one in a good price range and good quality... So i gave a shot for this peace of plastic for 11$. AND it works, I used it for two weeks now and I am pretty satisfied. Just like there is one more review on this item... and it says that it is strong and sturdy.. I AGREE.
It is a great item for the money.

It worked much better than expected. The page clips also were very good, but one fell off about 5 minutes into owning/using the item (I put it back on, but fell off a couple more times). I also get the feeling that the other parts are fragile as well.

I have tried a dozen holders; this is the best available.

Others tip over easily, or they hold only books of a limited size, or they are large, heavy, bulky, and therefore absurdly expensive, etc...

This is light, yet sturdy. Hint: I included a few large metal clips, the ones with long silver grasps that flip over and hold the pages in place. With the clips, this bookholder works excellently well.

In addition, it is also preforated to fit into any three-ring binder. The manufacturer thought of everything on this one. I keep one in the car for when I read in restaurants, another at home, and still a third on my office desk

Because I'm a free lance writer and reviewer, I often have to have books on a holder for reference or for when I'm direct quoting.

I had a book holder from another company, but it was a piece of junk. It wouldn't hold up thicker books and the thin, rounded "holders" at the bottom kept popping off. I even had my husband tried to fix them by shoring up the holders with tape and such.

It kept breaking and out of frustration, I went to an office supply store to look for another one. The silver Fellowes Book Holder was all they had. Although the clerk assured me it was a sturdy, I was skeptical. I had him go into the office, get me a thick, hardcover book--and proceeded to take the Book Holder out of the box to test it. (Yes, right there in the store!)

I was immediately impressed with the sturdiness and snugness of the wide holders at the bottom. The plastic looks flimsy, but I'm tellin' ya, this baby really does well for holding open thick books! I've been using mine for about a week now and love it. No more headaches when I need to get a quote! YAY

I read a lot and I was always annoying of having to hold the book open to a certain page.  I also hated having to try to type something from a book while having to hold the book open to a certain page.  Well, I finally decide to try this nice little invention, and let me tell you, it's definitely worth it!  It's cheap, but the plastic works fine and does the job well.  It stands up and holds the book to a certain page just as promised.  The stand is adjustable.  It's great, it makes my life so much easier, and I'm sure glad I bought it

I read the other reviews on this bookholder and wasn't so sure about it.  However, after buying and trying it out, I have no regrets.  Don't know why I waited soo long to get one (dont be like me and wait until you start to feel some neck strain from hours of studying hunched over before buying one).  Although made of plastic, it is very study and has nice rubber feet to keep it from sliding.  The clips on the bottom work very well to keep pages open and you can change how firm or loose you want it to hold.  Unlike other models, this one folds completely flat so you can carry it in your backpack between books.  I have used it mostly for softcover textbooks and have no problem

Sometimes I need to have a few books open at the same time, and still have clear desk space for note taking. I used to keep one in my lap, or close it with a scrap of paper in it to keep the page, or sometimes just put an open book on the floor so I could open another.  Not any more! Now I look back on those days and laugh at myself like a maniac until my face hurts because of what a total moron I was. What the crud was I thinking anyway??  This thing keeps my books open, and saves space on my desk. The little page holders fall out, but not all the time, so who cares? You're not going to loose them unless you've got a silver shag rug that's three inches deep, and it's not a big deal to pop them back in. 

In truth I have two of these pretty good book things

This stand is fairly sturdy and provides a wonderful way for those who enjoy reading or are dedicated students to avoid hurting their necks and backs.  It hold the pages open to their correct spots - although the page holders come out of their holders.  The page holders are easy to put back in.  It saves space on your desk.  I am a medical student and I have a notebook to write down important information from books I am reading as well as the bookstand and my textbooks.  It is a great device - considering bookstands are difficult to find

I wasted a day trying to get this to work on two different PCs.  The first, a Dell M50 Precision laptop with 1 GB memory and a 1.8 GHz processor, would capture sound just fine, but only color haze for video.  I thought that it was because the M50 has underpowered USB 1.1 ports, so I wasted the second half of my day on my newer faster desktop (also 1GB memory).  The best that I got was audio with the sound speeded up (voices sounded like they were on helium) and the same color haze for video.  Apparently, it doesn't pay to scrimp in this area.  I will promptly return the product and look for something better. From the other reviews, it doesn't appear that wasting more time putzing with tech support would prudent

Like so many others in these reviews (I should have read them first!), I can categorically say that this is one of the worst software/hardware products I've ever bought.  It does not work, tech support is useless, and you should not even try to make it work. I am a computer expert with a great computer, and there is ABSOUTELY NOTHING I can do to make this work.  Don't buy.

First of all, here are my computer specs:
Pentium 4 2.8 GHz/800 FSB
1 GB DDR2 RAM
2 SATA 7200 RPM hard drives: 80 GB (boot drive), 250 GB (movie drive)
Graphics card: ATI Radeon X300 PCIe 128mb
Sound card: SoundBlaster Live 24-bit
VCR: consumer-grade Sony SLV-N750

My DVD Xpress model number: USBAV-701 Rev. 2

My purpose: To archive old tapes to DVD.

Installation of the drivers/software was a quick and painless process. Within minutes, I was already capturing my very first video. This unit works very nicely with retail VHS tapes (I found that it does not respond to Macrovision, though I only tested one tape), home movies, and off-air master tapes (tapes that were recorded from television broadcasts). At first, I captured a short promotional music video at 8 Mb/s in a resolution of 720x480. This produced a video which was at least as good as the original tape. There are bars around the borders of the screen when viewed on a computer, but televisions have something called overscan which prevents all the extraneous stuff at the borders from being seen.

Then I captured a longer home movie, which clocked in at under two hours but would not fit on a single-layer DVD. My original bitrate of 8 Mb/s was too high, and the higher bitrate wasn't really helping the video quality too much. But if my bitrate is too low, the video will be of a poor quality when viewed on a TV. Perform a google search for "videohelp bitrate calculator" and click on the Videohelp bitrate calculator link. I use the calculator to figure out what bitrate I should capture in, according to the total time of all the programs I want to put on DVD. Below 7 Mb/s seems to be the cutoff point where more artifacts start to be seen during playback, but it's ultimately a personal choice based upon how you want to archive your movies.

After capturing this longer movie, I found the unit to be unresponsive and the bottom was extremely hot. Now, whenever I operate it, I point a small fan at it, and this seems to keep it cool and running well. But keeping the unit cool shouldn't be the user's responsibility, so it loses points for temperature.

While this device works well if the input video has a stable picture, a few of my tapes are of lower quality and have a lot of garbage in the picture from generational loss (being copied several times). I tried capturing one of these tapes, which was of a TV show from 1993, and the DVD Xpress did not handle it very well. The result had a lot of flickering images and was ultimately unsatisfactory. I am disappointed with this.

On the other hand, I have a tape that was recorded from TV in 1988. It is the master copy, so there is no generational loss. DVD Xpress was able to capture it just fine.

Not once during any of my captures did audio & video get out of sync, so credit where credit's due to ADS Tech for that.

After a few days of experimenting with this capture device, I definitely want to keep it. I look forward to finally being able to clean out my VHS closet.

My recommendations to other buyers: Understand your source, and you won't be disappointed. There is no way you can make your 10-20 year old tapes look pristine again. But if the video signal is strong and stable, the DVD Xpress should be able to capture it with no problems

I'm a little surprised at the average low rating this product has received from other users.  Currently I'm running an AMD64 3500+ with 1.5gig ram.  The software installed easily the first time with no problems and in no time I was recording my first transfer from a VHS player.  I'm very comfortable using Adobe Premiere Elements 2.0 so that's what I decided to use instead of the bundled software.

I've created over 25 DVD's successfully and tonight I decided to give the "Direct to disk" a try.  I recorded directly from the video source to the DVD and just like that, I had a single session recording that looked beautiful during playback on my DVD player.

I have nothing but praise for the ease of use and dependability of version 3.7.  I have used other hardware packages on lesser systems and yes, there were many problems.  But after upgrading to something with more power like the AMD64 with 1.5gig ram...well...it was a whole new ballgame.  Everything worked as advertised.  Just as it should

if you don't want to spend a ton of money and you want the  best quality possible.  i am using the ADS Tech DVD Express 2.0 mainly as tool to put shows that i have recorded on my DirecTV DVR onto DVD.  The quality is outstanding.  

2 quick complaints, but really these are only minor things:

1)  setting up was slightly difficult because i kept getting an error message saying that it wasn't receiving a signal and the plugs needed to be more secure.  the message should have said...."MAKE SURE THE USB CABLE IS PLUGGED IN DIRECTLY TO YOUR MOTHER BOARD"....in other words, in the back of your computer and with a USB port that came with your computer instead of an add on.  easy enough fix, but frustrating to get to that point and realize it was something that simple.

2)  on recordings i have found a slightly fuzzy gray line at the top of the video.  This has no impact on the sound or the video quality otherwise, but i wish there was a way to get rid of it to make a 100% pure video with no errors.  


this is a great product....don't look any where else

Look, for a bargain-basement product, what do you expect?  First, you expect it to work, and I can confirm it definitely does work.

When plugged in to USB, it signals XP correctly.  The driver software is very tolerant.  You can install it at any time and there is never a resource conflict or problems with the system recognizing the device.  So installation is a 5 minute process.

Next comes the capture and initial encoding.  Well, the software is a bit lame as far as features and GUI.  Typical.  But it absolutely saves in MPEG2 / DVD format just as you'd need it to for making DVDs of all your Dish Network or PS2 or VHS content.  

The frame rate is full on 30 fps.  It takes an SVIDEO or standard RCA video signal.  Both are just fine in quality.  The resolutions are not that great... but its passable for DVD when you crank it up.  Don't think you can encode some Blu-Ray quality MPEG with this though.

As far as the overall durability of the product, I've literally left mine plugged into the wall and running for about 1 year straight.  It gets hot, but its never so much as flickered or needed reset.  

Bottom line?  This thing is like a kids toy- its cheesy but tough as nails.  Get it for your first analog signal MPEG encoder.  Its a good value.

This isn't a consistent product. 99% of the time, I can't get it to work. After MONTHS of emails and phone calls, customer service responded. What a joke! They told me the plug in the unit and then unplug, wait 30 seconds, and then plug in. Gimme a break! I shouldn't have to do the Hokie Pokie just to get it to work. By the way, their process didn't work. Poor product, Poor customer service, Poor price

The DVD Express 2.0 worked the first time I tried it. It always helps to have a little knowledge of computers as most who have written reviews probably have. I agree that Ulead really sucks and they could have bundled better software witht he unit. If you are having trouble getting this little baby going I would suggest a computer class would be apropriate.

I purchased the 2GB Elite Pro SD card but found out that my older SimpleTech FlashLink card reader is not able to recognize the card under WinXP SP2 with and without the most recent SimpleTech drivers. I don't have another card reader for my computer, but the pictures recorded on it by my digital camera can be viewed on my PDA so I assume that it's the card reader. Shortly afterwards, I also discovered that Kingston makes a combo kit that includes their USB 2.0 SD/MMC reader for a bit less in price than the card alone.

I also noticed the ATP line of 60x and 150x SD cards. I have no experience with their products, but their SD cards are potted versus placed in a plastic shell. They tout their cards as being more rugged and waterproof. I'm very careful and have not had any flash cards fail on me, but with the rising capacities and smaller form factors, I will consider the ATP cards in the future.

This is a great buy because I have a lot of space. I use the card on my Digital Camera and I take a lot of pictures without download to the computer. I can go on la large weekend trip and take my pictures and download it until I`m back home.

I'm afraid I don't know a lot about this technology.  I went for economy and I am getting very good quality photos.  I think I would have liked more speed in taking successive shots and I really don't know if a different flash card would have made a difference or if the camera is slow.  Its still faster than my old one so I'm generally happy.  Hope this is some hel

I bought this memory card for my camera sd500.  At first, I was very dispointed when I only see 1gb on my laptop.  After googled around, I realized I need to update my laptop sd reader driver to recognized sd card that is over 1gb.  I'm able to see full 2gb after driver update.  Just make sure you update your device/laptop firmware/driver first

I'm a working photographer who has been, after several years use, getting write errors on my Lexar Professional CF cards 1 Gb and 2 Gb. I contacted Lexar about what to do and was told that the professional cards have a lifetime warranty and they are now in the process of replacing my cards, after 40K to 50K exposures on each. Quite happy with them

I used this CF card with my Canon Rebel XT. Write and transfer speeds are fast enough and never keeps me waiting. But this works bcoz of speed acceleration technology. If your camera doesn't support this technology then its of no use. It comes close to USB 2.0 transfer rates.

February 15th Update, finally this card failed. After formating the card will work for 15-20 snaps and will hang for ever after that and then the camera will throw a write error. Any amount of formating didn't correct the problem. Finally i have to dump it and now i am using one 1GB Sandisk Extreme III and another 2GB Sandisk Ultra II card. Both are working fine even after some bad handling

Bought this card as a backup for the 1-GB card I normally use, and it's been fast and dependable so far. My 7 megapixel camera produces large files -- lots of quick shooting can overwhelm the camera's buffer and force you to take a break from shooting, but with this card that hasn't happened yet. Good purchase.

Also seemed to be at the best price point in terms of storage per dollar

These cards only work with Camera that supports the Write Acceleration !! otherwise the speed is no different from a 12X card. There is nothing wrong with the card in terms of capacity or quality.

I have given a single star rating coz it should clearly state that the 80x speed is only possible with cameras supporting Write Acceleration !!

Very Few camera support this technology and one can easily get the same capacity ( 12x ) at 1/4 the mentioned price. SO why pay more if your camera does not support this technology !

<review_text>
If you own a Canon camera, Canon does NOT support WA (Write Acceleration) feature of Lexar's high-speed cards:

http://www.lexar.com/digfilm/wa_cf.html 

Current camera partners supporting Write Acceleration Technology: 

-Kodak Professional 
-Nikon 
-Sanyo 
-Sigma 
-Pentax 
-Olympus 

Other than that, this is a FAST card, if your camera supports WA, otherwise, it may run at just standard speed and in that case why spend the extra $$$?  Look up your camera on the link before you buy

I just purchased a set of two 4 channel Westinghouse intercoms and they worked only intermittently.  If I tipped one of the units, it worked sometimes, as though it had a bad connection.  I am trying to return them now to the seller.  Good luck if you purchase a set of these.  They seem to be hit or miss as to whether you get a good set

The one in our bedroom wouldn't always work, couldn't hear the kids calling.  I was unplugging my laptop charger at the same time someone was calling and discovered the charger was filtering the voice.  Both my Dell charger and Thinkpad charger had the same effect, even without the laptop plugged into the charger.  If your having problems, I would start with unplugging other things first.

Overall, these have been a Godsend, wife no longer has to scream at the kids across the entire house.  Used to drive me crazy

I have a 4300 square foot home.  I have purchased Novi wireless intercoms in the past and need to add to them.  One has been in the room above the garage, one in the kitchen, and one in the basement near the computers.  Those locations are not on the same circuit. I have never had any trouble getting them to work -- I've just had a couple wear out.  In fact, at our old house, we could pick up communications from our neighbors across the street who had a set and we finally each decided which channel we'd use so we didn't hear each other's conversations!  You might want to remember that when you use them!  Clearly our neighbors intercoms weren't on the same circuit -- they weren't even in the same house!  Maybe the newer ones (mine are at least six years old, but they are Novi wireless intercoms that you plug into the wall) have changed, but I've never had a problem like the one described.  Maybe it's peculiar to the Westinghouse brand

I bought a set of four Westinghouse intercoms.  Usually people buy intercoms because they have a large house and don't want to have to trapes all over it to communicate with other people.  These Westinghouse intercoms (and I believe the same goes for the NOVI intercoms) require that all itercoms be on the same electrical circuit (that is, controlled by the same electrical breaker).  So, if your kitchen, family room, master bedroom, and garage outlets are on different breakers in your main electrical control panel and you want to set up an intercom system, the Westinghouse system will not work for you.

Intercoms are usually for large houses...large houses usually have more than one electrical circuit for outlets...hence, this product likely will not work for most people.  I replaced the Westinghouse intercom system with one by another manufacturer called the WireFree Intercom Reporter...this is a four channel system and it works great...works either with batteries or transformer...it is independent of the electrical circuits

This is not technically a review, although based on what I've read I do plan on buying one of these.  However, I found something on smarthome.com which will inter-connect the two main circuits that most houses have, thus allowing devices like this (and X10) work from any outlet to any other.  This is not yet tested by me, but is at least promising.

Device is here:

I just purchased this unit and once I finally got it working I could not be more pleased. Just be warned that it was not as easy in my two story home to just plug one in upstairs and come downstairs with the other and have it work right away. Maybe I just have some &quot;funky&quot; wiring in this house, BUT I had to make about 6 trips up and down those stairs with a friend standing by the unit I wanted in the master bedroom while I tried various plugs upstairs until we finally got the things to work. All the electrical receptacles work fine, so I don't know why it did not work on the first try. Once working they are great...just keep in mind flexibility of placement in the event you have an experience similar to mine. I'm going to order another set to use between the den and my husband's workshop and feel they are a great deal for the cost and so much easier than a &quot;hard wired&quot; system

I bought this card to go with my Canon 30D and have not been let down.  I can get about 500 JPEGs and 300 RAW.  SanDisk makes highly constant products.  I can set the 30D to take high speed continuos shooting and take 5 RAW pic's and not have the card slow down my camera.  Very happy with it

This is a good compact flash card.  This is faster than most cameras can handle so there was no real reason to go with faster cards that are much more expensive.

Bought this card along with a Rebel XT as a gift for my girlfriend. It's been performing without a hitch so far, though on burst mode, there is transfer lag: in that, the pictures take a lot faster than can be transferred to the card, and so after the burst, the pictures are still being written to memory

I have an EOS Digital Rebel and was looking for a memory upgrade, at first I thought to buy a 1Gb Sandisk memory, but due to the price fall of memory cards I decided to buy the 2Gb card instead. When I inserted the card into the camera, it recognized the card right away reporting a whopping 575 photos in Large/Fine format or 262 in RAW format, that's more than I need even for a one week vacation trip, but if I upgrade my camera on christmas it may come just right for JPEG+RAW storage.

I may not be very technical about this but the read and write speed was noticeable faster than my previous two year old 128Mb memory card, about twice as fast either for browsing or saving pictures.

I have always trusted in SanDisk products and this card is no exception, quality and performance is as good as I expected

This is very well designed. It give you 4 USB Port but two on opposite sides. This is very clever becase you have plug in devices from both sides. You webcam or cell on your left and your mouse and number pad on your right. The cord that plug in from the Hub to the Computer is very sterdy yet flexible so you can not only adjust the Hub in all kind of angles, it would stay at that angle and not twist all around you wires. It also works great if you jsut want to charge you USB devices on the go. It come with a plug in AC adapter so you don't need to bring your computer along with you to charge youd devices

I,ve seen complaints about the ac adapter you "must" plug in. Hey guys, try it without an outside energy source, I just hope I,m not gonna fry something but it seems to work fine just plugged into a powered USB port. I have a VERY high end system though with wattage to sprare, but no more PCI slots, Damn 7900 512 gtx graphics cards, why do 2 of em have to take up so much room. Oh well, trade offs are a bi---, but a reality and 7 extra USB slots are awfully nice

This review pertains specifically to the Targus PAUH217U 4 Port Ultra Mini USB 2.0 Hub. 
The cord is about 2.5 feet long - long enough to reach from my pc, which sits on the ground, to the top of the desk. It has a cable which is split into two USB plugs - one just to transmit data, the second to power the unit. The second plug does not need to be used unless you plan on using some heavy-duty hardware, and if so what are you buying a hub called the ultra mini for anyways? If you insist on trying to run a blow dryer off the thing, then it does have an input for a separate power source, which you will have to buy separately. 

In short, If you have an old school machine with USB ports which are inaccessible /inconvenient to use, this little hub will give you quick access while taking up minimal space on your desk

I would like to believe that this hub works well- but I wouldn't know.  I bought it to reduce clutter on my desk from all my devices hooking into my powermac.  I hooked up my printer, ipod and digital camera and nothing happened.  I called Targus and they said I needed an a/c adaptor.  It doesn't come with one and doesn't say anything about one in the manual or instructions, or their website.  They said I could get it at radio shack and gave me the info (5 volt, 2.1 amp, center positive).  I've been to two radio shacks and online- they don't carry it.  I'm upset.  Any advice

It's speedy and space saving and inexpensive. I bought this to replace my Belkin because the Belkin needed to be plugged in. This one is powered by your computer so there's no extra power cords, which is a big plus to me. 

The only thing I dislike about this is the fact that the Hub takes up two Usb ports instead of just one like the Belkin.

PROS

Small
Cute
Self-powered - comes with a power adaptor.  I have 6 devices hooked up to it, including 2 USB Hard Drives, and it works fine without the adapter - a big plus for me. Most hubs would not work with this setup.
USB 2.0 & 1.1 - 6 devices hooked up, 3 low speed and 3 high speed, all work very well.
Runs cool.

CONS

Not sure why, but they put the 7 ports on one side of the hub and power/uplink ports on the other.  This is dumb.  If you have the hub on a desk it looks awkward.  All ports should be on the back and leds on the front.  Here, the leds are next to each port which makes them completely useless as you don't see them.  
The hub is very light so when you have lots of devices hooked up the font gets a elevated.

Overall, the best hub I've ever had and I tried many

It's a simple device, so there's not to say about it other than it does the job. You should note that the LEDs on the device remain lit as long as the device is plugged into your PC and the PC is powered (they glow a bright blue).

You will appreciate this product only if you don't have enough USB ports. In my case, I had plenty of ports, but needed an extension cable, which would help me in plugging the flash drives, whithout bending down and plunging into the cave of wires(I keep my CPU, under the table).The only complaint I have is the the wire lenght is not long enough.
Overall good value for price

I replaced 4 Novi units which had slowly failed over many years of use with 4 Reporters.  Attracted by the true wirless nature of the reporter, I was willing to spend the extra money over competitve brands.  Unfortunately the quality of the Reporter units is extremely poor as all four units failed after only a little ove one year of light use.  Failure modes ranged from no transmit on two units, no receive on one unit and completely dead on the fourth unit... all with new batteries and resetup per the instructions.  Don't waste your money

Truely wireless, the remote alert sender unit runs on 4 AA batteries. I don't know yet how long they last. Mine are now two weeks old and still good.  The unit senses when ANY movement passes by.  I live in the country and now I know when someone comes in the yard. Before I wouldn't always hear the car.  Only drawback is that it picks up deer, dogs and other critters walking past at all hours of the day and night.  I like this unit.  It serves a purpose for me that other people  may not have, but it works as advertised and nothing gets past it without it alerting me.  The range is said to be 1000 ft.  That is probably correct.  Mine is about 300 ft. fromt he reciever unit and it works great.  The two way "voice" speaker is the icing on the cake. I love being able to yell at the neighbors dogs to "get on out of here".  It's a real hoot to watch the surprise they get when my voice comes out of the tree.  I have less problems with the neighbor's dogs coming into my yard and bothering 'my' pets now

The Dazzle 6-in-one is perfect.  I have used it to transfer photos/files from my husband's camera (Sony Memory Stick), from my camera (ComapctFlash), from my Ipaq (SD card), and will try it with my new camera (SD card).  It's is way easier than bringing the USB cord and each camera with me.  This is one of the best purchases this non-techie has ever made.  (I have had this for over 2 years with no problem.

Bought this from amazon.  Worked well for compact flash cards.  Always complained that i should format the card whenever i used multimedia card (from kodak camera).  so i was never able to use it to transfer pictures from a kodak camera.  And all of a sudden, it died on me.  Had to throw it out

Simply plug and play. Additionally Dazzle Reader shows up as a separate drive under Window's. Easy to move files back & forth to the reader. Only glich is the stand -- very flimsy.. wish they had a better stand but the product is great and excellent price too ....

This reader (and writer) is absolutely fantastic! I bought this after returning the Biostar 6 in 1 reader from Newe*g. That unit would not read two SmartMedia units I had but the Dazzle knocked it out like a champ. I use it for Compact Flash and SM (4 different brands) and everything works great on the Dazzle. After the rebate the price is hard to beat!

I have been using a Minolta S414 digital camera. The batteries that came with it were only 1600 mAmps. I never got through an entire ballgame without having the batteries run dry. Of course I carried a spare set, but this was less than ideal. I got these 2000 mAmp Monsters and I must say they deliver what they promise. As a result, I've really not needed the backup set, even when shooting games that went into extra innings! The charger is well made, very quick and has easy LEDs to see the charge status from across the room. Overall, this has been a great purchase

Just purchased this inexpensive little unit and am amazed at the sound quality for such small speakers. It does just what it's intended to do - produce a very reasonable quality of sound from a portable unit. I had no trouble at all with the remote - it turns the unit on and off and controlled the volume and the iPod from a good 10 feet away. My only real complaint is that the instructions are woeful! Altec Lansing could do well to improve their in-box instructions which are far below the quality of the unit itself. I was almost ready to return my unit initially when I discovered - only by accessing Altec Lansing's web page for the iM3 - that I had to remove the not-too-obvious plastic dock adaptor that was already in place to put in my iPod 4G 60GB photo. Otherwise it is an excellent buy in my opinion and would be extremely hard to beat for the price

I bought mine for travel purposes and use the JBL On Stage more when I am at home. The JBL does sound better but I got a decent price on the Altec, it would dock and charge my ipod mini and also had the battery option. So I took it on vacation with me and it worked well but it did use 1 set of batteries per night. Thats 4 AA per night. Not exactly cheap. 

I think that those who complain about the lack of battery options in other speakers do not quite understand exactly how many batteries they will be using. I was out of the country but I still wish now that I wouldve taken my "heavy" adaptor with me. You live and learn. I guess everyone has special needs, but in this case I can tell you 1 set of 4 batteries would last only 1 night.

So, these are a decent set of speakers if the price is right. Packs well for travel but dont expect mindblowing sounds as its just a tiny lightweight speaker system. Its ok, Id give it more of a 3.5 star if I could.

I received this as a Christmas gift and while it's compact, there are a couple of major flaws.  The power button is the only thing on the remote that works.  None of the other controls on the remote work.  Second, it's VERY BASIC.  I would have preferred something that had some "sleep" or auto shut off mechanism that could be set using the remote control.  The only positive comments I have about this are that it's compact and looks tidy on a desk or shelf, and it charges the iPOD really quickly when it's docked.  Otherwise, the sound is mediocre and the controls suck.

+ Great sound quality
+ Powerfull enough to fill my living room (though probably not with 25 people in party mode) with a small footprint. 
- The remote requires you to point it somewhat accuretly at the speakers and is not as responsive as a remote for a tv. (Probably because the remote is tiny and only has a watch-like battery, so not enough power). 

Overall, very good quality for a reasonable price.

This system worked great for my 40 GB iPod. The carrying case and interchangable plug-ins are nifty for international travellers. A word of warning -- the 60 GB iPod Photo does not fit in the docking station. Altrec insisted that it does at the time I purchased it in July 2005. Be sure to order the "Altec IM3 for iPod and iPod Photo" that is now available if you have the Photo iPod.

I bought this product to use in my small office knowing that with the size of the speakers the sound would not be suitable for loud playing or large areas. With this in mind I have to say that I found the sound to be poor. Even with the bass turned up and the treble down it still sounded tinny and weak. I did like the fact that it accommodated my older, 1st generation iPod and had several attachments for the various versions of iPods. I bought it because it did accept my older iPod and because of the price, but I sent it back and bought the iM7 which has great sound and accepts my old iPod for a price that is not that much more

This product is [retty good, but don't even try putting a bood on it, the holder will tip over and it doesn't clip the pages of a book very well. But for papers it's good and it's adjustable, which is convient. It did hold my notebook very well, but for books it sucks.

This holder keeps papers upright and in position, but it doesn't handle books particularly well, as the clip cannot grip surfaces as thick as most books and the base isn't as wide as most books when they're opened. I have this AND a book stand so I keep myself covered on both ends

I'm amazed... simply amazed.  The price is way out there... and this obviously isn't for everyone... but it does everything it says... well.

Set up is super smooth,  get the manufacturer and model number, type it in during set up on your computer, and it is done.  Thats it.

I do have multiple lighting and heating controls and it is a snap to set up as well.  And then you can have the remote send the setup information to other controllers as well.

Tip: Don't buy their lighting controls... WAY over priced.  Anything that is Z-Wave will work... Leviton sells a line for 1/3 of the price

I have to say that I was a little bit skeptical because of the large price tag but found out through research that this product was actually fairly priced due to the custom programming features it had.  I quickly found out that this remote was better than other universals out there because it used RF and was able to control multiple AV systems in my house.

I have not done it yet, but I plan to buy the Lighting products so I can turn off all of my lights at once from bed each night!!!   Very cool

I've had a number of universal remotes over the years and each has had pluses and minuses to offer. The monster remote is a very effective universal remote on all accounts but there is ONE thing that stands out here above all the other remotes. Wireless control over lighting. I replaced my dimmers and switches with the Monster dimmers and switches and now I can control every light in my house. Monster really doesn't talk much about this feature but being able to hit "ALL OFF" at night on my way to bed and have the remote turn off all the house lights is killer. You can even map ligthing scenes to activities. If you hit watch a movie it can turn down the ligths at the same time. Really cool. Good job monster.

I gave this to my nephew for his birthday--hold lots of pics and videos (at least 250 pics).  I wouldn't say it ever cost as much as the "marked down" price, but was a savings for the same capacity card at the discount retail stores--about $15 cheaper.  I am pleased.

How many pictures will it store?  It is the most commonly asked question from digital camera enthusiast but usually the question that is the most difficult to get a straight answer about.  Well, considering I worked in the memory industry for over 7 years I can help clarify this perplexing question and do so unbiased as I have since changed industries.  

The Kingston 128MB Secure Digital Memory Card, like most 128MB cards, will store on average 142 pictures when used with a 2 megapixel camera, 106 images when used with a 3 megapixel camera,  64 pictures when used with a 4 megapixel camera, 51 images when used with a 5 megapixel camera, and 40 pictures when used with a 6 megapixel camera.  These numbers are based off the assumption that you are going to shoot your images at the highest quality JPEG setting available for the camera and understand that they are estimates and may be off by as much as 10 percent due to numerous factors including the complexity of the scene being shot and the compression algorithm used by your specific camera.

I truly hope this review was helpful to you in determining whether this card is the right capacity for your specific needs

SD cards are dropping in price on a daily basis it seems.

I don't like to use too large of a capacity since my tragic event at Disney took place. I had a 256 card and an error happened on my camera (which I have since trashed for this incident and bought a new Nikon) but anyway I had over 300+ pics on my card and could only pull off about 40 of DisneyWorld. I cried.

So as a suggestion...clean off your Memory cards after each event and don't go for the 512MB or the 1GB cards unless you are putting video on it or etc. 

Now I am a happy person once again since my hubby's going to take me back to DW to replenish those missing pics!

Bought this card for my XDA I PDA. Worked fine right out of the box. However, this only showed up as 118mb card !!! not sure if this is the SD card itself or the PDA causing the loss of some 10mb worth of space.

Also it is slow to write to the card, but quite fast when reading from the card.

How good an alarm clock is basically comes down to this: When you set the alarm with the three or four settings you need to do--alarm on/off, radio/CD/annoying noise,volume, and in this case the track you want it to play or if you want it on shuffle or not--does it actually do what you specified the settings to do.  The Sony Dream Machine does, and it features two equally accessible alarms as well so that husband and wife (or husband and husband or wife and wife as the case may be) don't need to argue over how to set the alarm for two morning schedules, along with convenient and easy to understand buttons for the radio presets and cd player controls. 

IMPORTANT NOTE: The two alarm settings are completely independent of each other, so one person can wake up to a CD and the other to a favorite radio station if they like.  My wife is from Japan for instance, and she wants a Japanese pop CD in there, while I'm partial to waking up to NPR news.

Best Feature--The Snooze button: It can be pressed multiple times at a shot to set how much time thereafter you want it to make another attempt at waking you, up to an hour later; and it's generously sized so that you can find it easily when you're not quite all there yet.

Worst Feature--the lack of any sort of backup battery.  For this price, they should just put in a long term one like computers have--providing just enough power to startup the system and remember settings.  I'm pretty sure a battery like the one Sony features in my video camera (circa 1998, TR3000 bought in Japan) would do the trick while only needing very periodic replacement.

Sound--good, not excellent, but it's an alarm clock, not a stereo.  For a kid's room or for your general purpose needs, the sound quality is plenty good.  No one needs 100 watts per channel, crystal clear sound to wake up to in the morning, and this little appliance does an exceptional job of serving both as an alarm clock and a handy, space-saving and attractive stereo.  It's perfect for not only the bedroom, but the kitchen as well.  

For the performance to price ratio, you could only do better by blowing the wad for a Bose unit.

Not for great-grandma: Younger grandparent-age people will probably be fine with it--say, as a gift--but if they're from the WWII generation or earlier, forget about it; in fact, forget anything with buttons or digital displays. Sony makes really excellent clock radios with the same reliable analogue features your grandparents have come to enjoy growing up but much improved, and they'll appreciate the thoughtfulness of such a gift much better--while this thing would just gather dust somewhere and be an entire waste of money or source of annoyance.

If I had to remark on one real downside to this unit, it's that the backlight really is too bright to sleep with it pointing at your face--and be close enough to reach without getting up--while being on a setting that is readable when you're still bleary-eyed.  Add that the control for the brightness is not conveniently located (it's on the back) so you couldn't just reach over in your half-coma state, brighten it, then turn it back down.  They should have added a feature like outdoor electronics have--such as cycling computers and GPS units--where you can press a button, it lights up for a moment, then goes back to it's preset brightness.

BOTTOM LINE: The best, most reliable, and enjoyable alarm clock I've ever owned.  It's durable, easy to clean, looks nice, and features two utterly independent alarm settings--so you'll only need one--in addition to generous preset buttons and easy controls.  It's really worth just exactly what Amazon is charging for it

I suffered with this clock for a year because it was a gift and expensive.  Even on the lowest setting the blue glow is so bright my finace says it looks like an alien spaceship is landing in the room.  The sound is so-so and it has no battery backup, lose power for a second and you have to reset everthing.  It is also very big, taking up 1/2 my nightstand.  The final straw was that it has trouble tuning in even the strongest radio stations where I live.  This morning I finally gave in, accepted reality and tossed it in the trash.  I won't miss it at all

Too many disadvantages:
1. No battery backup
2. Even on the brightest setting the clock are barely visible from the distance.
3. You'd be expecting better sound from this unit. It's acceptable with the radio, but CD sound quality is extremely poor.
4. etc.

One thing I don't like about this clock radio is that it doesn't have a backup battery.  Currently I usually do not need to rely on the radio waking me up in the morning, but when I do I make sure my Palm PDA is beside the bed to wake me if there was a power outage.

I tried the weather channels once, and it didn't pick up very well.  I have an older Sony clock radio (that loses time) that I can use for weather that picks up weather just fine.

What makes this a winner for me is the extendable snooze and nap timers.  Now if I want to take a nap I don't have to mess with setting one of the alarms.  I just push one button several times and it's all set.  I would buy the alarm clock for that feature alone.

I use the extendable snooze occasionally, but I don't know if there is a point at which it no longer works -- some alarm clocks for some unknown reason limit the number of times you can press the snooze -- this makes it unusable for me because I don't trust myself knowing that when I am half asleep!

Sound quality is great, I like how you can set the track of the CD and how loud it should be.  All in all a pretty good clock radio, but if you rely on it and don't have a backup, the lack of battery backup is a serious problem

We bought this clock radio, got it home, set it up, realized that it didn't have battery back up, called Sony only to find out that they do not find it necessary to put that feature on their alarm clocks....how bizarre!!  They do not carry battery back up on any of their new models according to their representative at the customer service center!  Boxed it up and it's going right back where it came from.  If it's okay not to have battery back up, it might deserve a chance, however, what's the use in having an alarm clock if you can't trust that it will indeed wake you up

Just purchased this Sony CD alarm clock and I have to say most reviewers are right on target. While it has superior sound quality and features than the competition, the rear light is very bright and the clock display is almost impossible to read from more than a few feet away. I placed a piece of electrical tape over the rear light unit to dampen the brightness and have decided to keep my 15-year-old Sony Dream Machine alarm clock plugged in next to the new one so I can see the time display off the old one from my bed. Still a satisfactory buy, because the competition produces hard to work,poor sounding crap

I really don't have much to say about this book holder, not that it's just a book holder.  It's a nice one.  It does it's job.  It's a little too expensive for just a piece of plastic.

It's strong, sturdy, and it's big enough, even for those massive heavy textbooks, like the Calculus ones.  Although, I would not recommend putting a dictionary or reference that's like 6" thick (even though it still may hold).  It's got little clamps at the bottom to prevent the page from flipping all over the place, although those tend to fall off when you move them.  But that's no big deal.  Just put them back on.  

This book holder is kind of big, and I would not put it on a small desk in the middle of a classroom, but it's not too big.  You should be able to put it almost anywhere when studying on your own time.

Looks slick, decent sound and great price BUT

flimsy attenna and CD player broke after 1 week (on its own - I didn't even open it up after loading in the first group of CDs).  Took it to JVC repair and they couldn't fix it or find out was wrong.  Ruined my impression of JVC.

It was missing the FM antennae. But I was not intending to use the system for the radio. Overall, it is a great system!!

Pros: it's pretty

Cons: it's garbage

Sure wished I had checked here at Amazaon before I bought this - I can't believe JVC put out such garbage!  So many of these CD players have broken that they can't keep up with the replacement parts (5 week wait?!!)

I guess I was one of the luckier ones - mine lasted almost 2 months before it died.

Bottom line: if you haven't bought yet, look elsewhere.  If you have, keep your receipt and warranty handy..

The CD trays are a little flimsy, but this audio system really packs a whollop. The sound is excellent. For the price, it has a lot of features, such as Bass/Treble control, a sleep timer, and five CD trays. To get an enjoyable sound, I'm willing to take the risk that a tray may break. I just try to be extra gentle with the trays

Strengths: sound, design, controls, 5CD changer, compact design
Weaknesses: remote is not well designed (all buttons the same size), doesn't recognize folders on CDs
Summary: I was shopping for a shelf system and this one caught my eye so I got it. The sound is excellent in my opinion for such a little system. The displey is also nice, very bright backlight which can be turned off (great when you like to sleep in the room while the system is still on). Overall I am extremely satisfied. The only minus is the remote, it has a lot of buttons and they are effectively the same size (I would prefer big ones for important things like volume, play, forward,...

Like many others here, my CD-changer died after a couple of weeks and it wouldn't read any CD. It's in for repair, but they say the changer part is on National back order and they don't know when they will be available. No surprise, I guess given the number that are breaking. The JVC parts web site says the changer is not available for "more than 3 weeks." I hope they will replace my unit with something that works

Great appearance and sound, JVC has produced a nice sounding unit.  Speakers look as great as they sound, no problem handling bass at loud levels.  Tuner is very easy to use, USB input works flawlessly.  Now the bad news, the CD mechanism breaks down and is unable to read any CD, whether store bought or MP3 burned.  First unit died after three weeks, the replacement lasted five.  CD player mechanical design is unable to handle light use.  Will think twice about buying a JVC again..

I have been trying to find a way to easily carry a lot of camera equipment for quite some time. I have tried backpacks, shoulder bags, duffel bags, but none of them really worked all that well. Then I saw the Lowepro Street and Field system with completely customizable pouches, vests, belts, and accessories. It works great, you only get the pouches you need so there is no waisted space and you can organize them however you want according to how often they are used (put frequently used items in easier to access places.) 

The variety alone of this system is worth the investment, but the quality and ease of use is also very high which is a big plus. You can get a case for any lens, camera body, or accessory you have. I even have cases for my cell phone and water bottle. One word of caution, be sure to measure your lens with the lens hood on backwards if you use them to make sure that the entire thing will fit into the pouch, because sometimes the lens will fit, but then the lens with the lens hood will not. I often carry 5-6 lenses, extension tubes, teleconverters, extra memory cards and batteries, and a bunch of cleaning supplies and other gadgets, which weights a ton. But when they are evenly distributed on this vest/belt Lowepro system it is actually very manageable. 

The only down side is that everyone will be staring at you because you have thousands of dollars of camera equipment strapped to your body. But if you can overlook that, this is the way to go. I have used this system at many zoos without ever having problems, in fact just unzipping a single lens and switching seems safer to me than opening an entire bag of equipment every time you want to switch lenses. Many of the cases also come with a built in rain/snow cover so if the weather changes all of your equipment is not destroyed. You can also put just a few pouches on a normal belt when you are just going to take photos in the back yard or don't need to take all of your equipment, which is nice. I really can't say enough about how much easier this makes traveling with a lot of equipment, if you have been hopelessly searching for a better solution, consider this, you won't regret it.

Buyer beware.  This reader does not work with large SD cards.  I could not get it to work with a new 4 GB SD card.  My 1 GB cards work fine, but anything over that will probably not work.  I confirmed with with Lexar technical support as they have not tested this yet

Before I bought this reader I considered 2 models 12-in-1: Lexar and SanDisk. I decided to buy Lexar.
I bought this reader to use mostly with Memory stick. I have 2 cards: 128 MB and 1 GB. I had no problem with 128 MB card. 
But I could not insert My GIG card into this reader. It just did not go. I tried hard trying not to break the card - no success. It was a surprise for me. May be because my card was made not by Lexar - by SanDIsk...? I contacted Lexar but did not get any explanation of this problem.
Any way I had to send it back and buy 12-in-1 SanDisk Reader.

This is very well designed. It give you 4 USB Port but two on opposite sides. This is very clever becase you have plug in devices from both sides. You webcam or cell on your left and your mouse and number pad on your right. The cord that plug in from the Hub to the Computer is very sterdy yet flexible so you can not only adjust the Hub in all kind of angles, it would stay at that angle and not twist all around you wires. It also works great if you jsut want to charge you USB devices on the go. It come with a plug in AC adapter so you don't need to bring your computer along with you to charge youd devices

I,ve seen complaints about the ac adapter you "must" plug in. Hey guys, try it without an outside energy source, I just hope I,m not gonna fry something but it seems to work fine just plugged into a powered USB port. I have a VERY high end system though with wattage to sprare, but no more PCI slots, Damn 7900 512 gtx graphics cards, why do 2 of em have to take up so much room. Oh well, trade offs are a bi---, but a reality and 7 extra USB slots are awfully nice

This review pertains specifically to the Targus PAUH217U 4 Port Ultra Mini USB 2.0 Hub. 
The cord is about 2.5 feet long - long enough to reach from my pc, which sits on the ground, to the top of the desk. It has a cable which is split into two USB plugs - one just to transmit data, the second to power the unit. The second plug does not need to be used unless you plan on using some heavy-duty hardware, and if so what are you buying a hub called the ultra mini for anyways? If you insist on trying to run a blow dryer off the thing, then it does have an input for a separate power source, which you will have to buy separately. 

In short, If you have an old school machine with USB ports which are inaccessible /inconvenient to use, this little hub will give you quick access while taking up minimal space on your desk

I would like to believe that this hub works well- but I wouldn't know.  I bought it to reduce clutter on my desk from all my devices hooking into my powermac.  I hooked up my printer, ipod and digital camera and nothing happened.  I called Targus and they said I needed an a/c adaptor.  It doesn't come with one and doesn't say anything about one in the manual or instructions, or their website.  They said I could get it at radio shack and gave me the info (5 volt, 2.1 amp, center positive).  I've been to two radio shacks and online- they don't carry it.  I'm upset.  Any advice

It's speedy and space saving and inexpensive. I bought this to replace my Belkin because the Belkin needed to be plugged in. This one is powered by your computer so there's no extra power cords, which is a big plus to me. 

The only thing I dislike about this is the fact that the Hub takes up two Usb ports instead of just one like the Belkin.

PROS

Small
Cute
Self-powered - comes with a power adaptor.  I have 6 devices hooked up to it, including 2 USB Hard Drives, and it works fine without the adapter - a big plus for me. Most hubs would not work with this setup.
USB 2.0 & 1.1 - 6 devices hooked up, 3 low speed and 3 high speed, all work very well.
Runs cool.

CONS

Not sure why, but they put the 7 ports on one side of the hub and power/uplink ports on the other.  This is dumb.  If you have the hub on a desk it looks awkward.  All ports should be on the back and leds on the front.  Here, the leds are next to each port which makes them completely useless as you don't see them.  
The hub is very light so when you have lots of devices hooked up the font gets a elevated.

Overall, the best hub I've ever had and I tried many

You will appreciate this product only if you don't have enough USB ports. In my case, I had plenty of ports, but needed an extension cable, which would help me in plugging the flash drives, whithout bending down and plunging into the cave of wires(I keep my CPU, under the table).The only complaint I have is the the wire lenght is not long enough.
Overall good value for price

This hub takes care of old power issues I had with smaller (unpowered hubs).  It is handling my pda, usb jump drive, high capacity external drive, and printer.  And I still have 3 more ports.  And I haven't had any USB power alerts from my computer since I added this hub.  It does what it says

In general, I have realised that CF cards have a 1-2 years life. This is my 3rd CF card in 5 years, and my 2nd Sandisk card to-date. My first (also Sandisk) is still working, but its only 32MB so not very useful on long trips except as backup. With a 5 Megapixel Canon, this 512Mb card stores about 200 highest resolution images.  Have used this for only 3 months so far, but have noted that the Ultra II is definitely faster than others. Quality and life seems to be better than the Viking cards I have used, but time will have to tell how true that is

I bought this card about 6 months ago when I received a Nikon Coolpix 5700 as a gift. I have to say, this card has never let me down. It writes images like there's no tomorrow, and it hasn't failed me once. I haven't lost a single image, and I don't plan on it while using this card. SanDisk has done it once again.
Buy from Amazon, I paid $20 more @ Staples for it

I'm not beholden to the SanDisk brand, and did quite a bit of research, and the overall reviews tend to point to this product as a great value. In fact, the "Ultra II" title does live up to its name, and am very happy with the performance of this product.  Canon 350D takes 3 frames per second in a continuous shooting mode, and this card had no problem keeping up with the pace, even at the highest resolution.  Download is speedy, too.

I went for two 512MB cards instead of a single 1GB card, for redundancy (keep one in the camera and process the other on a computer), and for extra insurance if one card fails for some reason.  

Highly recommended

I bought this card about 10 months ago to go with my Nikon D70 and I've certainly had no regrets. I haven't tried pushing the card to its limits to see how quickly it can write, but it's been plenty fast enough to keep up with me in single-shot mode. The card is always ready when I am. Downloading from the card to computer via my SanDisk Imagemate is fast too.

I like it so much, I'm buying a second one today

After reading reviews on every brand sold at Amazon I picked Pioneer since it was about the only brand that didn't have any complaints. I have only had it for a few days but the unit does exactly what is supposed to and does it excellent. It uses DVD- disks only but since I never have used DVD+ disks that option is irrevelent to me.

When I first got the headphones, I was frustrated...they seemed quiet...not much bass...didn't sound that great.

What I've read in other reviews is very true.  Having them seated in your ear properly makes ALL the difference!  I don't normally like things inside my ears, but I pushed it in farther and made them seat right...and now...VERY nice.  Not as loud as my other pairs of headphones...but they don't need to be.  They also cut out like 25-35db of outside noise...which means you don't need as much volume.  I've actually used these on plane trips just to cut out noise even though I wasn't listening to music at the time.

I hope you enjoy them as I do

Great sound quality, although the volume control attached to the wire gets in the way if you do not clip it onto your shirt. I recommend keeping the setting on "Bass" because otherwise the sound is sort of tinny and weak. Prepare to keep them in a clean pouch or plastic zip lock bag because you do not want to put dirty flanges inside your ear. The case it comes with is unpractical due to the amount of effort/time it takes to get them properly in there. Other than those minor issues, its great...I prefer these over any sony/ipod/or creative earbuds.

     One thing you will read in reviews when people first use the IM716 headphones is a complaint about how they hurt the listeners ears while running.  Had this customer read the manual they would read a passage explicitly stating how they are NOT reccomended to use while running, bycycling or driving a car.  

     I use them for long airplane flights, long walks between classes and relaxing at home, and these headphones are fantastic.  Once you get it situated in your ear correctly, it takes a few tries to figure it out, you won't want to take them off.  They are comfortable and the sound quality is incredible; this is assuming that you have your music encoded in a higher quality format.  If all of your music is encoded in .mp3 at 128kbs you arn't doing yourself justice.  I have some songs in apple losses and some in ACC 192kbs (w/ vbr) and I am very happy with the sound quality.  

     The clip, located about 6-8 inches below the actually earphones lets you manually adjust volume and select two different types of pla, Bass and High Definition.  The Bass will boost the lower range and that volume quite significantly (for those who complain that the earphones aren't loud enough) and the High Definition gives the listener a crisp tone that is a little bit more flat.    

     Overall, I am very satisfied with the product and would advise anyone who loves music to promptly go out and purchase them.  They are worth MUCH more than the 67.00 I paid for them

First,these phones are great but I want them in black.Now if you don't get a good ear seal they will sound horrible.The treble is silky,the mids are natural and the bass is tight,well defined and deep.I should know bass,I'm a bass player of 40 years and it's like being at a live show.Amazon sells these for $73 with nextday shipping.Get yours NOW.They take a while to get used to and might hurt your ears but deal with it because at this price,it's the best deal out there.The sound quality is amazing.My sony 71s are history.Enjoy from Bassin J.

After using my iM716s for about 4 months now I have a few things to say about them.

1) Price: Lists for $199 on Altec's site.  $70 is a steal.
2) Quality: Top notch in the earphones, the clip on the volume module is weak.
3) Performance: Bar none best I've had.  These things outperform the huge Logitech ear muff set I use mainly to mow in.  These things allow me to mow the lawn without having to jack up the volume to drown out the mower.
4) Conclusion: The only thing that stops me from saying these are perfect is the volume module can be a pain and get in the way.  When moving around, you NEED to have it clipped to something, otherwise it can create inner ear noise.  This can get quite annoying.  I've also caught the cord on things, causing the clip to bend away from the module.  It is removeable and I was able to bend it back.  If there were a pair of equal quality w/o the module, even for the same price, I'd go that route.  With that said, I am in no way regretting my purchase and will recommend these to anyone asking me about them or my 60GB video ipod

This is not my first InEarMonitor purchase. Prior to the iM716, I have been using Etymotics er-6i (both amped and unamped), which I had considered the absolute best-bang for the buck monitors. My background includes an interest in "hi-fi" since around 1960, and several years with guitar, string bass, piano etc....anyway..........these are the new champs in the under $250 price category, and strongly comparable to Shure E4, and Ety ER-4S. Negative reviews here reflect that some folks have little idea of how iem's are inserted/fit. Insertion is directed to the front and upwards (this is the natural direction of the ear canal). Also, don't be afraid of going too deep with them - you cannot hurt yourself with them and they demand a good seal. The iM716 is very good in presenting the details of a recording (they are derived from Etymotic drivers), but they are also very musical-sounding. My personal choice of tips for them is Shure Softflex (they fit perfectly). If you need foamies, then Comply works very well. The only questionable choice made by Altec Lansing was to put an in-line resistor module with them (giving you a choice of using them unamped from a power-weak player or switching the module to HD position for more refined sound which is best when amped (imo)(module also has a volume control). The downside for having this module is that it adds a bit of weight to the line. While I don't like this module for my usage, I can see where others could rejoice in its' inclusion.
The design is very attractive and I sometimes think of getting a second pair of them, simply because they are soo cheap and comfortable to me. These iM716's are now my go-to choice for portable listening.

I had been shopping for a pair of headphones with the ability to block out background noise for sometime now since I work in a loud environment. I had been really shy about buying this pair or any for that matter because some reviews weren't favorable. I was nervous. However, I bought these because of the name Altec Lansing has in audio. I was shocked when I first listened to them. I had to replace the rubber tips and use the foam ones because the rubber ones were just not that comfortable. But wow! The clarity of these phones are incredible. No matter what others said about these, I found the bass to be tight, but not booming. If someone wants booming bass like what would be heard in nightclubs, then they need to stay away from headphones period. If you are searching for a pair of IEMs, then if I were you, I would seriously consider this pair. Just make sure the seal is tight and they are in all the way, which I never really found that to be an issue. I don't really understand what others were doing wrong with that. If you bought these, I highly recommend it, you would not be sorry. I am thouroughly impressed with mine

This product works well. You can change the base part in order to fit a variety of holders. Theres room to plug in an fm transmitter on the port dock on the underside. I can even fit my ipod in this with a speck silicone case on it which is convenient

I was so excited to get this for my iPod.  I love listening to my music in my car, but was really disappointed when it wouldn't fit into my 2003 GMC Envoy.  There are two cup holders in the front, and granted they are in weird spots, but the TuneDok wouldn't fit.  If I put it in the front cupholder, it would interfere with the gear thing, and if I put it in the back cupholder I had no where to put my cups, plus it interfered with the box.

After I bought my iPod a charger, a tape adapter, an FM broadcaster, a case, a  running wheel, and a water bottle, I decided it needed a holder to keep it safe in the car.  These little Belkin numbers are quite nifty.  They hold the iPod in a nice position in my cupholder such that I can glance down at it instead of picking it up when I need to review the playlists/switch songs.  Overall a nifty product - now even better that it's a little cheaper.

With a price here on Amazon far better than some of the brick-and-mortar stores, this was an easy purchase to make. My car has unusually large cupholders yet, by simply flipping the base of the TuneDok over, I still managed to get a tight fit with no wobbling for my 3G iPod

If your iPod has a protective cover (e.g. skin, casing, etc.), then the iPod will not fit in the holder of this kit.  Otherwise, you can fit a bare (uncovered) iPod on it well.

* The kit fits well inside vehicle cup holders of various sizes, including adjustable cupholders.  
* The holder swivels, so you can have your iPod facing straight up or at various angles.  
* The opening at the bottom of the holder is convenient for plugging a charger into the iPod.  
* The holder uses a suction cup to firmly grasp the iPod.  It actually holds the iPod well.

Other reviews mention three cup sizes. More specifically, there are *two* cupholder inserts (small and large), a special bottom attachment (for either of those) to be used in adjustably-sized cupholders, plus a foamy cushion wrap that can be added to either of the cups for extra fill and stability. That makes (at least) six possible combinations, enough to fit any need.

And, yes, the holder tilts (and the cupholder insert swivels) to give you the best reading angle. But it doesnt tilt too loosely - you wont accidentally bump it into a different position while trying to change songs; it's even a bit bounce-tolerant, allowing you to push a bit harder without shifting the tilt.

Lastly, the cupholder inserts can be turned upside down, with the ipod holder screwed into the outside bottom (now top) of the insert, making a very nice desk stand for when I'm not in the car

I purchased this to use in my LG VX8100 mobile phone.  I have used it for MP3's and has been working fine.  I initially had some problems with playing the MP3's but found that Verizon had the MP3 setting turned off on the phone.  Once I corrected this, the Mini SD has been working fine.  Only once I had to eject it and reinstall it due to a read error but that may have been a function of the LG not the Mini SD card.  No problems since

I purchased the Mini SD 512 MB flash memory card for my LG 8100 to enhance the memory in the phone.  It was easy to install and I could use it right away.  Also it came with an adapter for the larger SD, so I can take the card to develop the pictures from the phone if I so desired

If you have a flash, this or a light sphere is almost a needed item to improve your creative range with your shots. Though, I highly recommend this product over the light sphere, as they both have about the same visual effect, but the light sphere costs dramatically more.

This device fits easily onto your flash and holds tight. No need for ugly tape or sticky velcro pads that look tacky. This thing merges into the form of your flash and looks like it belonged there the whole time. Looks aside, what does it do?

It diffuses your flash's light so you get a softer and more spread-out look to your flash. No more pictures looking like you're shining a spotlight on people. This has a more "natural soft light" look to it. I highly recommend it for indoor use, because you'll want a soft flash with it being the only light source, and the omni-bounce spreads out the light so you are better able to light up the scene and room.

The only downside is that since it is softening the light, you may need to adjust your flash output. You may have to dial up your exposure (meaning slower flash recycle times and faster battery drainage). The tradeoff is irritating sometimes, but well worth it for the improved looks in your photos.

This seemingly simple piece of molded plastic was recommended to me by a professional photographer. Basically it's the shape of an open box that slides firmly onto the flash. It is small and sturdy enough to stash in your camera bag without worrying about damage. When used the light disperses more evenly and is less harsh on the subject being photographed.

The white box is for general use. Also available are the green Omni-bounce for florescent lighting and the gold Omni-bounce for a warming effect.

PROS:
Inexpensive solution for better flash photography.
A quality product that works.

CONS:
Reduces the amount of light cast upon subject (should be expected with these types of products)

I am probably one of the most musically/sound impared people on the planet.  I rarely notice the difference between my onboard sound systems and my sound cards.  I only notice substantial jumps in sound technology.  I am very reserved about getting soundcards, as I dont think I ever notice a difference between 16 channels and 40000 channels of sound.  I have gone from a adlib, to a SB, to SB16, to Audigy LS and now to this card.  That being said, this is probably the last card I will even pick up or need.  The sound is a subsantial leap ahead of my other cards, and is amazing clear.  I love the front panel for adding my headphones if I need them.  I couldnt be happier with the price I paid or the product itself.

Amazing buy.  I cant say enough good things.  I dont speak geek about the improvements, its like art.. you know what you like, and I love this card

       I have had the X-Fi Platinum for about one month.  I upgraded from Soundblaster 5.1, a big upgrade.  I have an Asus Motherboard, AMD processor and NVidia video and have not had any problems at all.  I got the card to record vinyl to CD.  I have about 500 albums.  The advantage of the connections straight from the amp to the card were the selling point.  
       I have recorded some albums over 30 years old and they sound fine.  The recording software that came with the card works just fine from simple record to three levels of effects.  I have put recordings from the records on my mp3 and burned cd's.  Better sound than a casette tape and I've just scratched the surface with the software features.  
       I have a great improvement in overall sound and there are many uses for the features on the card and the software applications that come with it.  All I need is more knowledge on how to use all of the features.   The card is expensive but worth it, particularly if you have a specific use for it.  Take the plunge and enjoy the best sound available, you deserve it.

First off, not a perfect product far from infact, takes a bit of tinkering to work right and the instructions arn't really clear. I had the Audigy 2 ZS before this sound card and it was a simple install card, install drivers and your good to go; huge improvement over the onboard AC97. This was the first problem, the fact that I had drivers on my system from a previous Sound Blaster card, had to sweep them from my system. my next problem was that the X-Fi drivers that come with the card are beta at best and have conflicts with motherboard chipsets and video cards, but nothing that updates from there website won't fix (the original drivers must be installed first). Now why would I give a sound card that ships with sub par drivers a 4 out of 5, the sound is incredible. If the Audigy was step up from the onboard, then the X-Fi is a giant leap. Great for games and movies

Pros: Perfect sound, solved resampling issues

Cons: famous popping/crackling noises makes it useless for gaming, especially in BF2 (which use OpenAL by Creative). Crystallizer is useless.

This card has the most advanced sound processor which does not work on at least 20% of high end systems, not only NVidia NForce 4 chipset, but also with other AMD and Intel CPU motherboards: see Google for "X-Fi popping/crackling".  Even if you do not have in game crackling immediately, you have a good chance to get it after any memory or HD upgrade or driver configuration change. For long time  Creative denied existence of this problem. Eventually it was recognized (see official CL forums) and a new driver (since November 2005!) was promised at the end of May 2006, but beta version published 05/30/06 did not solve my problem. In the case of old audigy 2 zs the problem was solved with unofficial "hacked" drivers. I suspect that X-Fi crackling is an architecture design flow, which cannot be completely solved at software level, because PCI bus cannot provide sufficient memory access for the "the fastest sound processor" simultaneously with high end graphic card, HD controller, and other devices. 

Bottom end: I have to stop playing games, or go back to low quality integrated sound. Do not take risk, wait for working drivers, or buy a working card from different manufacturer. With fixed drivers I would give this card 4 or 5 stars.

UPDATE 06/12/2006
I found that many desktop motherboards (MB) have really slow south bridge (south bridge is connecting PCI, USB, Firewire, and HD to CPU directly or through north bridge), especially MBs with NVidia chipsets (and even with some Intel MBs). New beta X-Fi driver and MB BIOS updates solved the problem in many cases (but not for my MB Asrock K8NF4G-SATA2, nVidia 6100 / 410 MCP chipset), but situation is still marginal and X-Fi might go unstable again. I contact CL customer service, they did not solved the problem, but pointed out that ATI chipsets (Athlon 64, ATI 200 or 3200) have no problems with X-Fi. I decided not to return SB to seller, but save it for a new computer with ATI based MB. I guess that majority of workstation class MBs with upscale south bridge and PCI-X (even NVidia based) also should be fine with X-Fi. The trouble is that majority of X-Fi buyers have generic NVidia based MBs like me. So I can give X-Fi two stars instead of 1 (but I cannot change the rating), and even more stars if it will work well in my new computer of after new driver release (if it will work)

Hardware was A breeze to install.took about 20 minuets including the bay.Same for the software, no problems.Sound Quality is much improved over my old live card.In battlefield 2 game play is much improved on my 2.4/radeon 9700 pro/512.Before I would freeze framing during start in rooms, and during game play in intense situations.Now with the X-Fi I have none of that, and the game runs much smoother overall. Dvd movies sound much improved. Music is also much improved. The only problem Ive  had burning expanded mp3's is 1 didnt convert well out of 5 so far. Software interface is also A bit lack luster, but is functional. Card is worth the price, hopefully upgrades will improve interface.

The last soundblaster I had used was a soundblaster Live a couple of years ago. Since then, I've been relying on onboard sound on Nforce based motherboards. Sound quality was okay, but there always seemed to be issues with the drivers and a fair amount of background noise on the analog outputs. I decided to upgrade to the X-fi when I started to have sound dropouts while playing Oblivion. 

Sound quality from the X-Fi is great, especially with headphones. I'm only using the Drive bay I/O panel for the headphone jack, but the price of the Platinum version wasn't much more than just the basic card, so it was money well spent. If I had this set up as a media center PC, the remote control functions would make this an even better deal.

A few notes:
-I had no problems installing this on an NForce4 based motherboard (Asus A8N-SLI Deluxe)
-The I/O drive bay only comes in black. If you still have a tan case you're out of luck
-There is a digital SPDIF output available on the back of the card. It's a mini 1/8" jack, and unfortunately no adapter to RCA jack is included

I've been a Turtle Beach lover because I'm not a audiophile need most the best quality but can't bear with the poor quality with onboard audio. The quality Turtle Beach deliver is usually good enough and their package usually comes with a very good value. Been using Santa Cruz for years and it runs great. After upgrading CPU/Motherboard and to Z-5500, found the Santa Cruz seems to be lagging, usually about 3-5 glitches (sudden stop of sound) during mp3 playback. It might be my system's problem but anyway upgrade to Montego DDL fixed the problem. Used optical output on Montego DDL and it sounds good enough to me. But Montego DDL has a microphone problem (too low volume) that I can't live with.

So I tried X-Fi, only intention is to get the microphone problem fixed instead of getting better audio quality. When I put it with Z-5500, I can't believe the quality it delivers. I'm not audiophile but the difference is so obvious that everyone can tell. Some people complain about no optical output on XtremeMusic and no DDL on the whole X-Fi line. But you really don't need to. Man, the quality from 3 stereo cables at X-Fi is way better than optical output from Montego. This is when I reallized that for audio products, you need listening to compare, instead of looking (the spec) to compare. XtremeMusic should be good for most people but I still bought Platinum version for future proof anyway. In my value, not quality, oriented mind, I still vote for Creative this time. Creative beats Turtle Beach this time. Beats it really hard.

Of course, the microphone is fixed too

Memorex makes an excellent paper sleeve to protect CDs and DVDs from lying around gathering dust. The paper sleeves are also particularly good when mailing CDs and DVD discs because they protect the disc while reducing the cost of postage. It costs less to mail CD and DVD media in paper sleeves than it does to mail the same CDs and DVDs in slim jewel cases. This savings alone should make these sleeves pay for themselves!

The color white is neutral and doesn't distract you from being able to focus on the label or other writing on the CD or DVD. I agree with the reviewer who notes that there is a hole in the back of the sleeve into which you can insert a flap. This ensures that the CDs and DVDs don't dislodge when they are in transit in the postal system or your car as you take them from one place to another.

They are also useful for people who have accumulated so many CDs and DVDs that to store the media even in the slim jewel cases now takes up too much room. 

Overall, these are good quality paper sleeves at the right price. I highly recommend these CD/DVD paper sleeves for people who want a practical and cost-efficient alternative to jewel cases.

I purchased a pack of these memorex sleeves or a memorex version very similar to these at Circuit City without first looking at the price. I was astounished to be charged 7.99 plus tax. I purchased the same sleeves at Walmart later the same day for 2.99. Ciruit City has great prices on many things (particularly electronics) but these miscellaneous items can be waaaay overpriced. (Same is true of many items at Office Max). I am not aware of dvd or cd sleeves that are cheaper than these memorex sleeves (when purchased from Walmart or a simlar discounter at least) and they get the job done. These sleeves are fairly light paper but not nearly as light as the open-ended sleeve in which a netflix or blockbuster dvd is stored in. These sleeves do have a flap so the entire cd or dvd is protected

These are simply envelopes for your cds and dvds. Can't say anything else about them - except this - I noticed when I opened the box they came in 'my' sleeves were wrapped tightly with a rubber band which caused them to be somewhat crumpled upon removing the rubber band. It did not really affect them adversely, but just be aware that yours may come this way also

The 50 pack are all white, and the window in the front is a useful feature - lets you see what's on there without resorting to opening the envelope. The tab on the back helps keep the disc from falling out - a nice touch

This is the 1st IPOD I've ever had, and i've been using it constantly since purchase 3 months ago (for gym, work, commuting, planes). No real problems so far. The size is excellent, the look is sheek, and the navigating wheel is a lot easier to use than I was told it was going to be. Battery life is not too bad, i would say it can be used for about 10 hours before the battery picture turns red. I am dissapointed by the capacity- 500 songs is really NOTHING for people who've been buying CDs for 10+ years and enjoy variation in their listenting sessions. I was also dissapointed that you can't do anything with playlists on the IPOD itself- basically everything (eg, creation of playlists, deletion of songs, moving around of songs) has to be done on the computer & uploaded to the IPOD. Recommended for gym-goers and frequent travelers

Excellent MP3 player by Apple, Thin and very easy to use buttons. I bought it for my son and he loves it. The itunes software allows you to copy the CD into your library the moment you load it. However I found it difficult to copy songs into IPOD from CD. The software is very confusing. You have to first load the songs into library and then into IPOD. THere is no direct way. Sometimes the software would hang when synching songs. Also I could not figure out  how to easily load pictures on IPOD. It would be a great product if Apple can add FM radio in it. With a wide range of accessories available and the price rolling back It is a obvious choice over other MP3 player

It's conviently small, but not too small to lose in a purse backpack etc, but it has HORRIBLE battery life. I'm in college and listen to it while walking between classes or in the gym and I have to recharge just about every other day. Other than that it's great, just be prepared to have to recharge it ALL the time

Very happy with the Nano.   It was a gift for my girlfriend and she enjoys it thoroughly.   She struggled a little with the volume being to low, which was disappointing--till I played with the settings a little (I am a tech specialist, so it's second nature to tinker) and found that there was a second (master) volume setting that limits the output volume that is normally used when listening- Raised that and happy listening!

Good buy, good product, good amazon!

This is a TV card I used to replace my aged Lifeview FlyVideo98FM card, so I could watch/record (Trinidad & Tobago) games from TV during the world cup in June '06.

The TV quality is the best I ever seen from a TV card to date. Give that it is an ATI based card, this is really good stuff.

Unfortunately, the software package has let me down. The card came Bundled with Cyberlink PowerCinema. In day to day usage of my computer, I like to have the FM Radio function on. With the old card and 3rd party FM Radio software, there was no issues at all... With this new card, I often can't even load a webpage without the music sticking and stuttering - this on a computer with 1GB RAM and 2 hard drives! 

I definitely blame the software for this. If the sticking becomes too much then the Radio stops altogether. I'm forced to close and re-open Power Cinema to listen to Radio again.

TV is at least stable while doing other stuff, but you can't shrink Powercinema down to a 320x240 window. also there is a 2 second lag between TV and computer watching the same TV station. This never occured with the old card. Intervideo's WinDVR used with this card had no such issue.

It's a pity I don't have XP Media Center Edition (XP Pro I have) to compare XP's Media Center software with Cyberlink's.. Somehow I think Media Center will perform better. WinDVR works better too, barring that the software currently has no sound support for the card.

PowerCinema works, but it's not very intuitive. The software is written for the novice user with NO advanced options at all. When recording, you do not know exactly what quality you're using outside of "good", "better" or "best". You can't even change the default recording folder!

I am sure that this occurs with other brands of Theatre 550 Pro cards, not just MSI's version. 

As a side note, the remote that comes with the card works well.

In conclusion, It's a card worth getting if you can deal with PowerCinema's Issues, or find a better program to use with the card.

I own many Lexar memory cards and am very satisfied with their performance. However, I must add that LEXAR (USA) provides EXCELLENT service.   I live in Cape Town, South Africa..... whilst I was formatting one of my LEXAR cards in my Nikon D70, I terminated the formatting halfway (accidentally).... card was damaged.....  sent card to LEXAR USA after logging the problem in their website and within 10 days I had a brand new card couried to me by LEXAR..... no questions asked.... This is outstanding service!!!  Well done Lexar.....Exceeded expectations

When I bought my camera, the vendor included one of these cards as part of the package.  It was very quick--far faster than any of the 512MB cards I had on hand, even those that were of the previous generation of "professional" Lexar cards.  My camera seems to have no delays writing from its buffer to the card, to the point that I can easily shoot multiple frames per second repeatedly.

My only complaint is in the card's reliability.  After about a month of medium-load use (about 1000 photos taken), the card ceased functioning while within the camera.  Neither could my camera read or format it nor could any of my card readers (including the PC Card slot on my laptop with a CF adapter).  The image "rescue" software provided by Lexar on the card was of no use, either.

Lexar replaced the card, which has worked fine ever since.  However, I purchased a second one, which subsequently also failed after about 2000 photos taken.  Again, the included ImageRescue software failed to help--it found errors but could not do anything about them--but a commercial image recovery tool I purchased was able to read, then reformat, the card, and it has worked reliably since

I purchased the Lexar 1GB 80x Pro CF card for use with my Canon EOS Digital Rebel XT 8 mega pixel DSLR camera. I also have a SanDisk 1GB CF card which I also use with the DSLR. Of the two cards the Lexar is far and away the fastest in recording & reading, I can take multiple shots at the camera's highest resolution (8 Mega Pixels)yet never have to wait for the shots to be saved before shooting more. There are also no compatibility problems.

To be fair to the Sandisk, it's an older model I purchased a few years ago for a MP3 player, however I now use it only as a backup to the Lexar.

I plan on buying a couple more of these cards in the near future

I just purchased the Canon 20D and this card is a true marriage of the two necessities.  Plenty of picture room and I plan to purchase a 2GB prior to my trip to IRELAND.  Price wise I did great and the turnaround time was excellent.
This card was ranked No 1# in two seperate on line test so I was very sold prior to my purchase.

If you find that they UPS is briefly cutting off power at computer boot up, there's something wrong with your configuration. The UPS is purposedly cutting off power in order to cause the computer BIOS to restart the computer. This happens only after the UPS has sent a shutdown signal to the computer. You should not power on the computer until the UPS is done with its power up procedure. If you want to take advantage of the automatic computer restart after AC power is back, you should set your computer BIOS to Power On when AC power is restored. Since, while the computer is off, it doesn't know when the power comes back on, when the UPS cuts off power briefly this is the signal to the computer to power itself back on

I installed this unit on my HP AMD 64 X2 with a 19-inch LCD monitor.  Installation was very straightforward, with no problems experienced.  The unit has two rows of power outlets - eight outlets total.  All are surge protected, but only one row has battery backup.  Each row includes an outlet that is offset to allow transformer power supplies to be connected and still accommodate use of the other outlets.  The unit also surge protects the incoming telephone line, and interacts well transparently my DSL service.

The unit comes with a USB connector cable that is used to transfer information between the unit and the computer.  Also included is "PowerChute Personal Edition" software.  This software replaces the UPS option used under the "Power" icon of Widow's XP Control Panel.  PowerChute PE allows user selection of alarms and power options to best fit the user's needs.  PowerChute PE automatically loads at computer startup, and resides as an icon on the right-side of the Window's task bar.  It monitors the unit's status, and provides information concerning abnormal power events that have occurred for future reference.

In order to assure that there is enough battery power for this unit to operate properly, I only attached the PC and monitor to the powered row of outlets.  Transformers seem to use a lot of power, and to gain the most time available for adequate shut-down times they should only be plugged into the "surge only" outlet row.

When A/C power fails, the unit immediately picks up the power load.  It will then begin to shut down the PC if A/C power does not become available shortly .  The default method it uses is to place the PC into "hibernation mode", saving the desktop exactly "as is" for future start-up.  It accomplished this task with my PC perfectly.

If I had wanted a UPS to keep my computer running for several minutes during an A/C power outage, this is not the unit I would have purchased.  However, to keep my system from re-booting due to the power being interrupted momentarily, or to shut down the PC safely should the power outage last longer, this is a cost-effective solution for those tasks.

I had the same experience as the reviewer on 11/17/2005.  I tested the UPS by shutting off the power at the breaker.  Within a minute, the UPS software shut down the computer (I had set for 4 minutes, so obviously the battery wasn't going to hold up long.  Only load was computer, monitor, and router).  At any rate, the shut down was successful.  But upon power-up, about 30 seconds into the reboot, the UPS beeped and cut power to the battery-backup outlets, which killed the computer mid-bootup and killed the router for a second or so.
Absolutely worthless, as the whole reason I wanted the UPS was to prevent shutdowns during the occasional 2 minute power blips I have here

I would not recommend this unit for most computers as the battery is too small to provide reasonable runtime.  Under a 200W load it only lasted 3 minutes while the Back-UPS ES 500 lasted almost 12 minutes.  The ES 500 is only slightly more expensive but provides much longer runtime.  In my opinion this UPS is only good for very small loads (less than the average computer)

The manufacturer only lists software compatibility with OS 9. Guess what... Mac OS X (works great with 10.3) has built in support. Just plug it in to a USB port and it's available in the system preferences pane under Energy Saver. From there, you can set auto shut down and monitor the battery charge in the unit.

This is definitely recommended for smaller computers/monitors or people needing short run time. I'm using it with a PowerBook so that I can gently spin down my attached external hard drives and still have protection for surges on the printer and speakers.

You might want to consider the BackUPS Office 650 (Model #BE650BB) instead. You get considerably more run time and 2 more outlets (8 total instead of 6 total on this unit)

I don't own this specific APC product, but I do own other APC products.

My home was hit by lightning on July 2, 2004 during a severe lightning storm. Both of my garage door openers were destroyed during the strike and they were on separate NET3 power line surge protectors made by APC.

NET3 surge protectors offer the best ($50,000) damaged equipment warranty that APC offers. APC refuses to pay for replacement garage door openers since in their determination, the surge protectors are functioning properly (I had to send the surge protectors at my expense for analysis at their labs).

I will never contend that a surge protector can protect any device from a direct lightning strike, but the APC warranty contends that they will replace your equipment in the event this unfortunate event occurs.

I now do not recommend APC equipment, since their warranty is worthless

I bought 5 of these for the computers in the house. I would have got better ones but the house has an auto generator so all I need is about 30 seconds of power. I noticed in another review the person saying there unit was going of and on battery mode even when the power was still on... To my understanding this unit detects (dirty power) and when it detects it, it will then stop accepting ac power. I think the software it comes with allows you to turn the feature off or even turn the sensitivity up

I have had this for about 2 years and I travel about 100 days a year by car.  I have it hooked up to my laptop, which is on the passanger seat.  It has never left me down.  In fact I would be lost without it, literly.  I tracks where I go anywhere in the US with the existing software.  Nothing else to buy !!!  It pinpoints where I am at anytime.  It's GREAT.  If you travel a lot like me via car, and have a laptop, a VERY GOOD, AND LOGICAL PURCHASE

Consider another receiver before buying Delorme's. Delorme's receiver works only with their software (the receiver does not conform to any standard, unlike most other receivers.) The Delorme software itself is not very accurate. Just in looking at the area of a few blocks surronding my home, I found 3 instances where a facility was shown as being located several blocks from where it actually is - but Microsoft had no problem locating the facilities properly. Finally, with the receiver I have, even after the device as been initialized, Delorme's software sometimes is unable to find it. (I suspect that is because the cable on the GPS side sometimes pulls slightly out, but fiddling with it doesn't seem to accomplish much). Real irritating out on the road, as it is when you find one of their printed atlas has been misbound and lacks several pages

I have an earlier version of this program and the antenna. It works well in the car with my laptop. I did not have the trouble others had with service. I ordered their latest version of their 3_D Topo map program. It was scheduled to be shipped in late March, 2001. I had an immediate need for the program and called them. I talked to a real person who directed me to the right people to write to. I asked for a Beta version to use until the new version was released. In less than a week I received the full version (not the Beta version). You can't get better service. Every one of their products has worked well for me and have installed easily

I've had this product for over a year and use it with my Nikon D50. It has performed flawlessly in less than perfect environments, example: blowing beach sand, salt water mists, and in high heat and humidity.I bought one for my daughter recently and she has been quite happy with its performance in her Canon SD600. Would buy this brand again

The card worked fine for my son's graduation and a family holiday but became corrupted during my brother's wedding and I lost all the photos from that event.  I still can't believe it happened.  If you have an iPod, or other, remember to back-up your photos as soon as you can to try and avoid this

It's the fastest and most realiable SD card I ever used. I heard SanDisk has released a newer one that's even faster, but this one is all I need. I bought two 512MB cards to be used with a digital camera (Nikon D50) and never lost anything

I have several Sandisk products USB Compact Flash and SD, have been purchasing thier flash cards since the early days (10MB & 15MB cards)  Have allways found them to work great and a good value (dollar cost) for the quality.  The new ultra II SD card is my second SD, also have a 256MB card (also Sandisk not ultra however)  These cards work well and keep on going like the Duracell Bunny!  There are a lot of cheaper cards but not many that compare in performance and quality

There's a review here where someone takes their COMPUTER and analyzes the performance of the card.  Unfortunately, most of the time what matters is how the card works with your CAMERA.  A camera generally doesn't move data as fast as a computer, and it has to process it first - so those tests really only measure how fast you can download the images (or other files) to your hard drive.  If that matters to you, great.

For the rest of you, especially camera users, here's the real story:
- You need a faster than standard card if you plan to use 30fps 640x480 video.  It's also a good idea with high resolution cameras, if they are especially fast at processing and writing the images.
- But ... I just bought a different 512MB SD card for $10 after rebate.  It's hard to beat that price / performance ratio if you're just storing photographs.  Sure, video of the 2 year old nephews is fun a couple times a year, but other than that, regular speed cards work fine for many uses.

Always buy what's right for your needs.  And, if the price differences are small, go with the faster card.  

There are promotions every week on various memory cards, look for one if you have time.  Those can make higher speed cards a good value, though the standard speed cards have gotten so inexpensive you may want one as a backup as well

I have been looking for an easier way to protect the front my my lens without having to either take off my lens hood or trying to fumble around with the lens cap with the hood still on.  Op/Tech came up with the solution!  All you have to do is stretch the proper size hood hat over the hood and everything is protected and ready to go.  Super easy to take off, putting on takes a little more time, but you never miss a picture putting it on anyway.  Basically this is an inexpensive way to add some extra insurance against getting dirt, water, etc on your front element while you are walking around looking for shots.  It is also very flexible and easy to stick in a pouch or pocket when not being used

 I had owned an LG burner and from the time I got it, it never worked right. I must have made 60 or 70 coasters before I decided that it was'nt the media, it was the crappy LG brand burner. I was really afraid because there are so many burners on the market and all of them claim to be good, but as I found out with my LG experience, that is not always true. 
 My brother has an older model Sony burner and although his is slow, it has made a handful of coasters in the 5 years that he has owned it, so I took a chance and purchased the Sony DRU-810A. That was the best decision I could have made. I will never buy another brand burner other that Sony brand. I have had this burner about 7 or 8 months. I am a very heavy burner and I have not made one coaster. 
 One thing I loved about my brother's Sony burner is that I could use any brand of media. The same thing is true of the DRU-810A. I don't have to worry about where the media was manufactured or who the maker is. This burner loves everything. I had looked at the Plextor brand, but I did'nt want to pay $100.00 and I looked at NEC brand, LiteOn, BenQ. etc., but I am so happy that I passed on them all and got the Sony. It burns super fast. Some people say that it is loud, but it's not loud to me.
 I got my burner from Tiger Direct for $50.00. My sister's computer came with a crappy LG brand burner too and for almost 2 years she has not been able to burn at all because she gets nothing but coasters too, so for Christmas I am buying her a Sony DUR-810A so she can finally burn some movies. For my money, this is the best burner bar none.

The drive works great.  It was a bit difficult to install in my Sony computer as the two faceplates that came with the unit were different than the ones on my computer case--seems like Sony could pay attention to a bit more standardization on such simple things.  Service from Amazon was great as expected

I have been trying to find a way to easily carry a lot of camera equipment for quite some time. I have tried backpacks, shoulder bags, duffel bags, but none of them really worked all that well. Then I saw the Lowepro Street and Field system with completely customizable pouches, vests, belts, and accessories. It works great, you only get the pouches you need so there is no waisted space and you can organize them however you want according to how often they are used (put frequently used items in easier to access places.) 

The variety alone of this system is worth the investment, but the quality and ease of use is also very high which is a big plus. You can get a case for any lens, camera body, or accessory you have. I even have cases for my cell phone and water bottle. One word of caution, be sure to measure your lens with the lens hood on backwards if you use them to make sure that the entire thing will fit into the pouch, because sometimes the lens will fit, but then the lens with the lens hood will not. I often carry 5-6 lenses, extension tubes, teleconverters, extra memory cards and batteries, and a bunch of cleaning supplies and other gadgets, which weights a ton. But when they are evenly distributed on this vest/belt Lowepro system it is actually very manageable. 

The only down side is that everyone will be staring at you because you have thousands of dollars of camera equipment strapped to your body. But if you can overlook that, this is the way to go. I have used this system at many zoos without ever having problems, in fact just unzipping a single lens and switching seems safer to me than opening an entire bag of equipment every time you want to switch lenses. Many of the cases also come with a built in rain/snow cover so if the weather changes all of your equipment is not destroyed. You can also put just a few pouches on a normal belt when you are just going to take photos in the back yard or don't need to take all of your equipment, which is nice. I really can't say enough about how much easier this makes traveling with a lot of equipment, if you have been hopelessly searching for a better solution, consider this, you won't regret it.

I recently received this card from one of the vendors that works through Amazon.  It did NOT have the notch at the bottom (as another reviewer suggested indicated the product may be a fake), so I phoned SanDisk and was informed, based on the serial number, that the card IS authentic.  So apparently the lack of a notch on the bottom of the card is not cause for concern

I bought it for my Canon S3 IS. First I tried it without formatting and fill it up with photos and video and no problems. Then I did the suggested format by Canon and it worked the same: perfect. Fast enough to cope with the demands of the camera; haven't any problem of corruption. 

I've been tempted to buy another one.

It's a memory card and it works!  I have never had a problem with any memory card I have owned including this one.  I was told SanDisk was a good brand and so far (5th memory card of theirs I have owned) they have all been reliable

This card allows me to store 330 pictures at the highest resolution and the lowest compression.  If you want less resolution and/or more compression, you can store over 1,000 pictures on this one card.  The other big advantage is the very fast transfer times to and from my PC

This flash drive worked fine for me and then failed after about 8 months.  I used Viking's online help and found it to have fast and helpful response.  They offered some suggestions on recovering the drive and when that failed, they gave me an RMA to ship it back for a replacement.  I had a new one within a week, no hassle, no fees (other than the $1.50 to mail it back to them).  

   I never expected such great customer service.  The new drive is working fine, so hopefully that was just a bad batch

This USB Flash Memory Drive works exactly as described, and I'm glad I bought it.  I didn't give it 5 stars because its size makes it a little inconvenient to use.  My laptop has two USB ports, one directly under the other.  This device is big enough that it prevents connecting a second USB device to the other port at the same time.  I've given up on the rebate.  It's been nearly 5 months, and follow-ups have not helped

When I paid somewhere between $20-$30 a couple of months ago for the OptiFix Pro Kit, I made the wrongful assumption that a high price tag would entail good craftsmanship in contrast with some of the cheaper radial cleaners I've owned before.  The package's description made it seem promising enough and I've had mostly good experiences with Memorex in the past, so I just had put it to the test immediately after taking the product home.  After reading the instruction guide carefully before use, I'm positive the product was being used properly, but unfortunately, the OptiFix Pro just couldn't deliver the goods.  In fact, not only could it do nothing to restore any of the discs I inserted, it worsened the scratches it was supposed to repair!  What's more frustrating - two of the discs it served to further damage are out of print and therefore irreplacable.  I hope fellow CD collectors will sympathize with my message and steer clear of this particular Memorex product

I had two unworking disks (One a PS2 game and the other a PSX game) so I picked this up and both work fine now! The only thing is you'll have to run it through a couple times. If you run it through once you'll see little difference... But for the price and since it does work... eventually, I still give it a 5 out of 5.

I have this unit and it works great to clean dirty DVDs, like those bought used from Blockbuster or Hollywood Video often are.  However, it is often far below what is usually needed to repair disks.  [I did get one (of two) 'unplayable' DVDs to work after using the repair function of this unit.]  I'd suggest taking damaged discs to a large DVD rental store to see if they can repair it.  If they cant, with their $600+ machine, it is probably a throw-away.

My main complaint is that I can't find where to buy the cleaning pads without buying the repair pads and much more cleaning and repair fluid.  I hate to have to pay $7-$8 for stuff I don't need.

[My collection is now at over 1800 different DVDs, so I have some experience with cleaning them.

I had a DVD that was scratched during shipping. One repair kit did nothing to help it. I considered using the Skip Dr., but I never cared for what it did to the disks. My church's Media Center uses the Optifix system, so I decided to try it, too. The scratch was gone, and the DVD plays with no problem whatsoever. I'll admit that not all scratches can be repaired this way; some scratches cannot be repaired at all. I just know that it worked great for me

I bought mine at Wal-Mart for $20, followed the instructions with two scratched DVD's from the library (one badly scratched, the other still playable) - and saw almost no change in the scratches or playability.  It's going back in the morning.

This model relies on an aluminum oxide paste (superfine liquid sandpaper) to sand off the scratches.  I think I'll see better performance from one of the products that actually fills in the scratches rather than sanding down the rest of the disc.  

For cleaning, just get one of the inexpensive manual cleaners with the little bottle of denatured alcohol - they work just fine

I'd had quite a few previously viwed DVDs that had scratches.  As a result, my DVD player would freeze.  This product fixed a couple of DVDs for me.  As far as the haze, you can use a lint free cloth to wipe the haze or a bottle of Optrix afterwards.  I stopped buying DVDs new unless I can get them via gift card or in a bargain bin

This SanDisk CF Type I/II ImageMate USB 2.0 Reader/Writer is a neat little device.  I just pull the Compact Flash card out of my camera, stick it in the ImageMate, plug the USB cable in and grab my pictures without having to mess with a camera/computer transfer or worry about draining the camera's battery.  I'm running XP SP2 and didn't need to install a thing.  I just plugged it into the USB port and XP found and recognized it.  The only reason for giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is that I wish it plugged directly into the USB port itself (like the Simple Tech BONZAI USB 2.0 CARD READER -- though that uses SD/MMC cards instead of CF) instead of having to use the separate (included) USB cable

I spent $10 on a MediaGrear keychain CF card reader first. That reader is usable, but it is hard to pull my CF card out. I think that reader's pins are very likely to damage my CF cards if I insert and pull my cards very frequently. Then I decide to get this brand-name reader, with $20 at bestbuy (not a very good price). And I am very satisfied with the product. When you insert your card into the reader, it is not like a floppy which goes all into the reader. Just half of the card is inside the reader. So I don't need to pull it very hard when I want to get the card out, it comes out smoothly and I no longer worry about damaging my card. When I plug the reader into my computer, it works immediately, no need to install any driver if you don't need to use that transfer button.

From appearances and description, this appears to be identical to my SDDR-92 (no A15) except for the shape of the button.

This SanDisk is an excellent unit - compact and reasonably slim, with a detachable USB cord.  It is perfect for carrying in a pocket of your laptop case (unlike my Dazzle which is fine for a desk top, but awkwardly shaped for compact storage).

The unit is reliable and fast, and, unlike the 8-in-1 or 12-in-1 units which use up four hard-drive letters, this unit only uses one hard-drive letter.  It supports reading, writing, deleting, etc., and works with either USB 2.0 or USB 1.1.

If you do not care about the button software, this unit installs plug-n-play, without needing a driver CD (at least on Win 2000 and XP).  It simply appears as a removable hard-drive letter in Explorer.

I did not install the button software because I am not a fan having extra transfer mechanisms and photo organizers on my computer.  I would rather be in full, manual control of how and when things happen, and where files are put.

I think that this is a 5-star unit, but I downgrade my own unit to 4 1/2 stars because of its overzealous packaging and arrogant installation instructions.  In both the instructions, and on a sticky label on the unit (which I still have not been able to fully remove), it proclaims that you MUST install the button software before connecting the unit.  I ignored that warning, and the unit worked fine without any installation needed.

One of the important requirements in a card reader is portability.  Since not everyone takes kindly to your installing software on their computer, the card must be able to work just by plugging it into the USB port.  The SanDisk SDDR-92 meets this requirement, although it proclaims not to.

This is a good choice for a CompactFlash Reader/Writer.

This controller is absolutely phenomenal. Not only is it wireless, but it corrects my only gripe about the Microsoft S-Controller:

I'm 6'3", and have fairly large hands. I love the layout of the S-Controller, but the "arms" are too short for my hands. This leads to pretty nasty cramps in my pinky fingers during long sessions, and ends runs in Forza and Call of Duty long before I'm ready to quit.

The Logitech controller's arms can't honestly be more than a half-inch longer than the S-Controller's, but it makes a world of difference. I highly recommend this controller not only for it's fantastic wireless performance, but for actually being *more* comfortable than the S-Controller.

Another reviewer posted a gripe in regards to the lack of a memcard/headset slot, and it's a valid complaint. I found the perfect solution in the Logitech Wireless Headset, which can be had here for $20. It works great, and it should be noted that Microsoft still wants $30 for the standard wired headset, which comes with an incredibly-weak clip for the boom mic.

All in all, this controller is absolutely the best one you can find for the Xbox. Pair it up with the wireless headset from Logitech, and you have a completely wireless control/chat setup for $50 a pop. You honestly can't do better, for any amount of money

The controller is exactly like the Microsoft controller so the transission is easy plus the freedom of being up to 30 feet away from the T.V. and not having a cord in the way.  The controller works perfect

Wireless is the way to go!
When I put any of my wireless controllers down on the table they look like they belong there and not out of place... 

Singular and clean looking this Sweet little controller is, IMO, another triumph by Logitech!

Though a little smaller than the S-type, it feels good in the hand and it does not slack at all in performance. I got mine used and, once again, put old batteries in it(takes 2)...even four months later, I am just now getting the low battery light flashing...

Still Vibrates
Still Responds Acurately
And the analog sensitivity is better than the wired.

Get it, get it... GET IT!!

I was impressed with this controller at first, and found it to feel comfortable, and work well. It was played with once and a while for about a month (total 10 hours max). Some time after that, the next time I went to use it, it would only go left in a game that used the left joystick. I could not get it to center (or even stay still), it would just keep either steering the car (like Burnout3) or whatever the left joystick would do for the game no matter what. I tried it several times, and it has never worked since. I fire it up once and a while to see if it's still doing it, and it does. I am very dissapointed in this, and I was pretty careful about getting this newer version of the Logitech controller. I think I paid about $45 locally for it, and I just bought a Pelican Extreme edge from Radio shack on clearance for $19.99 that works and feels as good, but is less than half the cost. I don't really feel like going thru a warranty claim, if it's even covered, but it still annoys me every time I look at it in my Xbox 'drawer' of extra stuff.

I was going to go totally wireless (4 units) and luckily didn't run out and buy 3 more of these Logitech controllers. I instead bought some extra Microsoft S controllers, as they are still one of the best feeling controllers out there. If the Pelican holds up, (model PL-2050 version 2.0) I might go get some more if I can find them locally.

I am a gamer and i know a good controller when i feel it. This is a horrible controller. I mean it works well for maybe like a week or two, in that time you love it...but after a month its breaks down and turns into a heap of crap thats a dread to play with. The triggers just become extremely sensitive past the point of enjoyment. I swear the triggers are sensitive to gravity. I'm just playing halo 2 and out of nowhere my finger isn't on the grenade trigger and i just threw a grenade. It can spoil a good game of halo in an instant. Occasionally it disconnects from its receiver which makes it useless until you push the connect button on the receiver. Which takes about 10 dear seconds. After the contoller started breaking down, i had just bought a normal green microsoft xbox controller and it was a breath of fresh air. This controller is [...] and don't bother picking it up.

I love this controller.  I have small hands for an adult, and the pad fits me well.  I like the shape better than even the now-standard Controller S shape.  I have no problems with delay or drift.  I haven't used the D-pad, but the thumbsticks and buttons work great, though I'm not a terribly heavy user.  This pad works better than either the Pelican Eclipse or Soul that I own.  My Madcatz Lynx is better, but way too big for my hands.  I like the feel of the plastic.  The only thing I would change would be making the thumbsticks a bit shorter and concave on top, though I've never had a problem with grip

I bought this item not to cool my laptop, but to provide some insulation from the heat when it's on my lap sitting in a chair. I'm very satisfied with it's being able to accomplish that. HOWEVER, the cord ended up breaking after a few months. Targus replaced it at no charge which is good, but still a hassle. Now one of the two fans has started making a racket when I first turn it on. After a bit it settles down but very noisy at first.

I use a laptop since I am always on the go. I noticed that my laptop often gets hot since it is on all the time. I thought that getting this would help reduce the heat and possibly help the performance of my laptop. It works and the quailty of the product seems to be great, but it really doesn't do much, if anything at all. I think the idea of the cooling pad is great, but not effective

You're money is better spent on another product.

It's made out of plastic so it feels cheaply made.  A nice thing about the product is that the fans are incredibly quiet, damn near silent, if it isn't damaged.  I had one fan made a scraping noise.  

The fans are designed to draw the heat from the laptop, but I've found that these coolers are less effective than the laptop coolers that blow cool air in.

What an amazing product for such a small price.  It works right out of the box, but to get full functionality you need to install the encolsed drivers.  The option of mouse or pen makes it useful for everyday PC work as well using the pen for graphics.  I use it mainly for teaching via phone and use the whiteboard in messenger to communicate in words and pictures.  It really makes a difference.
The unit seems well made and I like the fact you can personalise the tablet to add a picture of your choice.  I opted for the smallest in the range for value, and was not disappointed, but I am sure for more commerical use or for artwork a much bigger screen would be better, but at cost.
The software bundle is ok too if you don't already have photoshop tools.
The one quibble is that at home when I installed the drivers it continued to crash my PC with my wireless keyboard installed.  Not ideal, but as I dont use it at home any longer it is not a problem for me, but be careful, I am sure there will be a fix somewher

Before purchasing this Wacom, I did a lot of research and decided it was probably worth a few extra bucks to get one with a good reputation. I have no complaints. I can't complain about the size because I knew what 4" X 5" amounted to before I bought it. The clicker on the pen takes a little getting used to, but what doesn't? Like the title says, it's just what I was hoping for

If you do a lot of photo retouching, the Graphire4 will give you a lot more control than a mouse.  The pressure sensitivity is very helpful when you are masking. The lighter you press, the less dense the mask is.  It allows you to "paint" in the correction/effect.  

The absolute mode (location of the pointer on the screen is based on exactly where you touch/move the pen) of the pen takes a little while to get used to and I still seem to have a little trouble with it after switching from the mouse.  But after a minute or so of using it, it comes pretty easily.  I think it might be a real pain on a larger tablet.

It's fun to use too

I'm a seasoned graphics pro who always reads the manuaI, and have owned several previous models of Wacom tablet. For the life of me, I just couldn't get the Graphire4 working on my Mac at all. The installer crashed (Kernal panic!) my otherwise rock solid Tiger installation. Downloading the latest driver from Wacom's web site was only marginally useful; the cursor jittered like crazy no matter how I adjusted the control panel, and even moderately fast motion caused it to "submarine" from one side of the screen to the other. Wacom's sparse FAQ suggested that interference from my monitor might have been the culprit, and could be remedied by moving the tablet further away. It didn't work, and besides, I have no plans use the tablet from across the room.
Phone support was no better: Wacom very thoughtfully gave its staff July 3rd off! Too bad, it would have been a chance to talk me in to keeping it. Looks like my trusty workhorse Intuos2 tablet will be enjoying a few more years of service, if this is the level to which Wacom's legendary tech support has fallen.

I purchased the 2GB Elite Pro SD card but found out that my older SimpleTech FlashLink card reader is not able to recognize the card under WinXP SP2 with and without the most recent SimpleTech drivers. I don't have another card reader for my computer, but the pictures recorded on it by my digital camera can be viewed on my PDA so I assume that it's the card reader. Shortly afterwards, I also discovered that Kingston makes a combo kit that includes their USB 2.0 SD/MMC reader for a bit less in price than the card alone.

I also noticed the ATP line of 60x and 150x SD cards. I have no experience with their products, but their SD cards are potted versus placed in a plastic shell. They tout their cards as being more rugged and waterproof. I'm very careful and have not had any flash cards fail on me, but with the rising capacities and smaller form factors, I will consider the ATP cards in the future.

This is a great buy because I have a lot of space. I use the card on my Digital Camera and I take a lot of pictures without download to the computer. I can go on la large weekend trip and take my pictures and download it until I`m back home.

It's a great card at a very good price

The initial flash card that came with my camera was far too short to save pictures.  When I went surfing for another flash card with some depth, Amazon really came through for me and the price was excellent.

I'm afraid I don't know a lot about this technology.  I went for economy and I am getting very good quality photos.  I think I would have liked more speed in taking successive shots and I really don't know if a different flash card would have made a difference or if the camera is slow.  Its still faster than my old one so I'm generally happy.  Hope this is some hel

I bought this memory card for my camera sd500.  At first, I was very dispointed when I only see 1gb on my laptop.  After googled around, I realized I need to update my laptop sd reader driver to recognized sd card that is over 1gb.  I'm able to see full 2gb after driver update.  Just make sure you update your device/laptop firmware/driver first

This adaptor is great, especially for the price.  Installation was as easy as it gets, right out of the box.  I had it up and running through a WEP-enabled local network and surfing the web in 2 minutes.  It locked on to the network in under a second and never dropped the connection.  Both FrontPage and ClieMail ran fine.  Speed is maybe 80% of what I get on my laptop running a 333 MHz. Celeron and a PC card 802.11b adaptor.  Just be sure your PDA is on the (small) list of supported devices.

Negatives: it's not the sturdiest looking thing in the world.  I wouldn't leave it in the Clie when not in use and I sure wouldn't want to drop it on the floor.

It does chew through the battery, but not any more than the backlight.  I did a test with my UX40, with the backlight set at minimum (ie. not off entirely) and using CliePet's UnderClock app to slow it down to 96 MHz.  This is a good combination of power saving and usability.

Then I got on the net and loaded pages non-stop.  Starting from a fully charged battery, it ran 55 minutes before the first alarm.  I was able to get another 20 minutes of intermittent use out of it after that.  I consider that perfectly acceptable.  With an EB40 extended battery you should easily be able to get 2 to 3 hours of use out of it.

Overall, a great add-on for a fraction of the price of a UX50

I bought this card for my TJ25, supposedly a supported device. But the problems with this card make it nearly useless:

- It comes with a web browser that doesn't work.
- Even if the browser DID work, it would only work for 30 days before you had to buy the full version.
- The only downloadable browser that works with the card is Eudora, which doesn't do anything except display text (you can't even fill in web forms with it, so webmail, searches, etc. are impossible).
- The card is designed to work with NetFront and CLIE Mail, software that comes with Internet-enabled CLIE devices... obviously not what you would have if you were buying the card. These programs are not available separately.
- The card wouldn't connect to either my wireless network or the neighbors', even though my PowerBook has no trouble connecting to either, no additional configuration required.
- While attempting to connect, the card would often stop responding, and then lock up the handheld.

Bottom line: if you want a web-enabled PDA, buy a web-enabled PDA. Don't buy this

I got this card last month and I've been using it heavily. Its been great. Its sturdy and can has great range. There are a few problems though.

#1 There is no case for the card.
#2 The included browser only lasts for 30 days and its horrible. Luckily I had NetFront 3.1
#3 Memory Stick LAN software will occasionally error, but a soft reset will fix it.

Otherwise its a great little expansion card

It is compatible with the models PEG-TJ27, PEG-TJ35, PEG-TJ25, PEG-UX40, PEG-TG50, PEG-NZ90, PEG-NX70V, and PEG-NX60.
The WLAN card works great and I recomend this for every Clie user who wants to go wireless

Voltage input can be either 110VAC or 220VAC, which is very important in other countries.  Nickel Metal Hydride batteries are better than old fashioned rechargables because they do not necessarily have to be totally discharged before recharging. Charging units are compact and light

This WorldWide charger is the best that i have ever used. I use this mainly for my camera. Nowadays I don't even bother to charge frequently.

But a small drawback would be then can have provide AAA batteries as well in there pack so that we do not buy them individually.

I purchased the 2GB Elite Pro SD card but found out that my older SimpleTech FlashLink card reader is not able to recognize the card under WinXP SP2 with and without the most recent SimpleTech drivers. I don't have another card reader for my computer, but the pictures recorded on it by my digital camera can be viewed on my PDA so I assume that it's the card reader. Shortly afterwards, I also discovered that Kingston makes a combo kit that includes their USB 2.0 SD/MMC reader for a bit less in price than the card alone.

I also noticed the ATP line of 60x and 150x SD cards. I have no experience with their products, but their SD cards are potted versus placed in a plastic shell. They tout their cards as being more rugged and waterproof. I'm very careful and have not had any flash cards fail on me, but with the rising capacities and smaller form factors, I will consider the ATP cards in the future.

This is a great buy because I have a lot of space. I use the card on my Digital Camera and I take a lot of pictures without download to the computer. I can go on la large weekend trip and take my pictures and download it until I`m back home.

It's a great card at a very good price

The initial flash card that came with my camera was far too short to save pictures.  When I went surfing for another flash card with some depth, Amazon really came through for me and the price was excellent.

I'm afraid I don't know a lot about this technology.  I went for economy and I am getting very good quality photos.  I think I would have liked more speed in taking successive shots and I really don't know if a different flash card would have made a difference or if the camera is slow.  Its still faster than my old one so I'm generally happy.  Hope this is some hel

I bought this memory card for my camera sd500.  At first, I was very dispointed when I only see 1gb on my laptop.  After googled around, I realized I need to update my laptop sd reader driver to recognized sd card that is over 1gb.  I'm able to see full 2gb after driver update.  Just make sure you update your device/laptop firmware/driver first

We had purchased a DVD recorder and within 5/6 months of continued use we noticed the picture quality was very poor, I contacted the place that we had bought it and they suggested we invest in a lens cleaner as we had used the unit heavily over the last 5/6 months.
We bought this product and from the time of cleaning it has worked perfectly. I will recommend anyone having problems with their DVD player/recorder to try this first before sending the unit to the repair shop as I was about to do.

I have a Sony DVD player from about 4 years ago that was top of the line at the time, and would still be good today if functioning. 

Recently however, it was seriously malfunctioning.  I would put a DVD in, and it would keep spinning, but then not recognize it at all. It would recognize and play CDs, but they would skip constantly. 

I decided to give this a chance for $5 to see if I could recover my player. I ran it once and it seemed to skip less, but would still not recognize DVDs.  I thought , maybe if I put it in repeat and run it a few times it might work.

Voila!!! I couldn't believe it, DVDs were recognized and played again.  So give it a try, maybe run it a few times!!!

My DVD player was ready to be thrown out, until I saw this product on amazon.  My DVD player wouldn't even load a DVD.  It kept saying "please check disc". After loading this disc, my DVD player has worked perfectly ever since.  Don't spent $30 on one of these "clean up discs". This one does the job

Hi,

Hey, don't run to the repair shop just yet and don't kick that DVP/DVR to the curb too soon.......help is on the way!!! My DVR was giving me grief not reading or writing to discs properly until I fed it this Memorex CD/DVD Laser Lens Cleaner. WOW, it worked like magic!!! It's been nearly 3 weeks already and not a single error message and it plays and records like the day I purchased it. If you own a CDP/DVP/DVR a Memorex Laser Lens Cleaner may save you a costly trip to a repair shop......it certainly did in my case!!! Just my two cents.

I purchased this product after quite a bit of research and after finding that it was finally available for windows I couldn't wait to get my hands on one.Why wouldn't I? it's supposed to be the best thing since sliced bread. At first it looked like a really cool product, and is, if your system is a Mac. 
Logitech has done a great job of selling the Nulooq to Windows system users but only give you half of the software to operate it on. There is no tooldial for the Windows version ( a fact that they don't disclose ) which is probably the most powerful feature of this product. 
I now feel as though I have wasted my money on what is a useless tool ( if you have Windows ) and been totally conned by Logitech.
What is even worse is the fact that Logitech don't have any future plans to include the tooldial driver for Window users. So if all you want to be able to do is zoom and scroll then this product is for you....and I know where there is one for sale!!!

I love my tooldial and its' software.  My only complaint is that you must have a very large proccessor to run it effectively.  I frequently find that it gums up photoshop and in-design a little.  Overall great product and I expect them to have some updates to work out the bugs.  Works very well in tandem with a WACOM tablet

Been waiting for the Windows version since I saw the product at PMA on Mac earlier this year.  Used the Windows version from the very moment it was available.  I touch up pictures all day long and being able to move the picture around all day is great.  Tiring using the space key and moving the mouse for hours on on end.  

Adjusting brush size is the best.  Bracket keys never cut it for me.  I think the product does more, but just taking advantage of those two items is a huge timesaver and a stress saver.

If you do touch up work in Photoshop all day long, this is a must have

The NuLOOQ is an inexpensive and really fun way to fly through images in Photoshop when cloning out specks or needing to move throughout an image with lightning speed. The Pan/Zoom function is tremendous! 

It's a programmable tool where you can add photoshop tools and actions to the Tooldial for instant access at the mouse location, rather than moving to the menu bar all the time. This is a great time saver because you can program in redundant tasks to appear on the tool dial to be clicked in a moments notice.

Changing brush size is as simple as turning the tool tuner to the appropriate brush size, in real time.

I highly recommend it to speed and simplify one's workflow

I bought a NuLOOQ when it first came out for the Mac. I've been an Illustrator & Visualization Artist for 17 years now. I have an iMac at home and a PC at my full-time job. It takes a little while to break some old habbits, but once you do, and get used to the NuLOOQ device, you'll never go back! I love this smart toy! I got so hooked on it, I recently purchased one for my PC here at work. If there is anyone out there that thinks it's just for the Mac your wrong! The PC version is just as good! It's become part of my left hand and I still use my Wacom tablet all the time also! To me, this is a must have for any beginner or advanced artist using the computer; cross platform. Bravo to Logitech for making another great product! Get one...I'll guarantee you'll get hooked on it

Logitech scored a big plus with this item.  The important thing is that you really need the processing power for the device to run properly.  The first review is really unfair.  Logitech does not hide the fact that you really should be using the NuLOOQ on a G5 processor. It says so right on the box. I'm using it on a G4 1.8ghz and I feel that I'm behind a bit with power. To review the NuLOOQ on a G4 800mhz is ludicrous.  Of course it won't perform to the rigid standards of todays graphic professionals on an underpowered box. Hook this thing up to your updated Mac and you'll see it shine. My workflow has been streamlined and I enjoy the more tedious tasks more than I ever did.  Good job on this one. I recommend it highly

I bought this item with great expectations but was disappointed enough to return it today.  One big caveat on performance however, I am running an older 800 single processor Mac G4, which, although I use it in a professional graphics capacity every day (Photoshop), is a bit pokey by todays standards. After downloading Tiger 10.4.6 which is required for the tooldail app. I got the thing going. This is what I found  1)  Evan after setting all the Tooldial prefs to the fastest speed I got slow and jerky navigation w/ the nav ring... Overshooting the area I wanted to see because of a delayed response.  Also, to pan upwards on the page requires reaching over the top of this 2 inch tall device to press (with a firm pressure), on the far side of the ring, which requires a repositioning of the entire hand.  Poor ergonomiics in my opinion, seems like they went for a sexy look/concept instead.  2) An Ipod type dialing motion is fine on an Ipod,  but on this device took many rapid circles on top of the tooldial to effect much change in Brush size etc. and seemed much less sensitive and intuitive than a rub strip on a music synthisizer or a waacom pressure pad.  3)  The trigger points funtion, but require surprisingly  heavy pressure to operate,  at least 6 to 7 times the pressure of a mouse click. This kind of treatment 8 Hours a day would send my aging wrists to the glue factory within a week....  There may be a device out there that will someday "revolutionize my workflow", but this isnt it, Back it goes...

I am a photographer whop purchased this for use in Photoshop.  It exceeded my expectations, and continues to amaze me daily.  I now use it for everything from my Safari Browser and iTunes to games.  It is truly a flexible and fun product that is easy to use with many applications!
It is by far the most innovative product I have ever used...and the Tooldial software it comes with is AWSOME!

I use this in conjunction with the SanDisk Ultra II 2.0 GB compact flash card.

I like it, but the flash card doesn't slide in easily. Sometimes it get stuck halfway, as if the unit has not been designed properly and the sliders for the card offer enough give to slide the card to the left or right of the pins.

To add insult to injury, both the reader and flash card are manufactured by SanDisk. Therefore, they SHOULD work seamlessly together, but pathetically, they don't.

I'd much rather pay more for a reader that worked great, rather than save a few dollars for a reader that makes you work every time you use the thing.

For comparison, my camera accepts the card perfectly. There is no give at all, but instead is an effortless process.

Not a quality reader.

Other than that, it works as expected. Surprisingly, the reader doesn't topple over as easily as I thought it would. It stands vertically and looks like it might fall over when trying to slide the card in. Sliding the card in a 2 handed process, so one hand holds the unit while the other slides it in.

Removing the card is extremely easy. That's a one-handed process. "Eject" the card from the PC's drive and then remove it.

Data transfer from the card to PC is very quick.

Overall, I'm glad to have it, but it's an annoyance to use it. I hate the card getting stuck halfway in the reader

This is a great card reader for the price. Why pay more if this one reads the all cards that you have? Personally, I only use CompactFlash and SD cards. It reads these cards and it does it fast and reliably.

The shape of this card reader is a bit awkward but then again it does help you grab the unit while inserting and removing cards, which you'll want to do a bit carefully. It would be a bit more difficult to do that with the unit lying flat on the desk. Remember to never force the card in and remember the label side faces towards the Sandisk logo on the card reader. It is slightly tricky to get the cards into the slots at first, but once you get the feel of it, it beccomes quite easy and routine.

This Sandisk has LED indicators that are helpful. One Amber LED to tell you the unit is connected to your USB, and other green ones by each card slot to let you know either that you have a card insert (solid green), or that it's reading or writing (blinking green).

This card reader comes with a 1 year warranty and I feel it represents a good value. I would recommend it

The Sandisk reader is impossible to misuse. It loads quickly and it's compact shape offers most options for memory. It can be mounted vertically with attached stand for sleek ease of use or compacted flat to be discreet. I would prefer a little more weight so that it doesn't move around on my desk so I'm giving it only 4 stars. If I had to replace this reader, I would buy another SanDisk

The DVDs are a rip-off, although I'm counting on the REBATE to at least break even (not counting my time).

The DVD player completely fails to recognize them.  Even after extensive troubleshooting with Disk Management and ensuring my regionalization was not an issue....  

Just a poor product -- Velocity ought to be ashamed.  More Taiwanese junk.  (I'd recommend Verbatim's DVD+R DL product - made in Singapore)

As a note I can get other DVD-Rs to work just fine...

I haven't submitted the rebate yet, so no comment on the veracity of other negative rebate comments

I agree that these are not top of the line. But they aren't bad at all. I get coasters occassionally even from top of the line media.

I always burn at half the speed the media is designed for - 2x in this case. It takes longer, but I get good results. I am rarely in a hurry to burn a DVD.

I would buy these again.

** Updated on 7/3/2005 **
I have bought a new computer recently and I have been burning these DVDs with full speed supported by the writer and no coasters what-so-ever. Very happy with this product

They have no label on the top (hard tell which side is up).
These are the worst DVDRs i have ever seen and used.
The Speed is much slower than other brand DVDR such as Ridata.( although they are both 4X). 3 of 4 DVDRs got errors during burning. But Other brand DVDRs are 100% OK.

I am going to return these package to Amazon.

I have been trying to find a way to easily carry a lot of camera equipment for quite some time. I have tried backpacks, shoulder bags, duffel bags, but none of them really worked all that well. Then I saw the Lowepro Street and Field system with completely customizable pouches, vests, belts, and accessories. It works great, you only get the pouches you need so there is no waisted space and you can organize them however you want according to how often they are used (put frequently used items in easier to access places.) 

The variety alone of this system is worth the investment, but the quality and ease of use is also very high which is a big plus. You can get a case for any lens, camera body, or accessory you have. I even have cases for my cell phone and water bottle. One word of caution, be sure to measure your lens with the lens hood on backwards if you use them to make sure that the entire thing will fit into the pouch, because sometimes the lens will fit, but then the lens with the lens hood will not. I often carry 5-6 lenses, extension tubes, teleconverters, extra memory cards and batteries, and a bunch of cleaning supplies and other gadgets, which weights a ton. But when they are evenly distributed on this vest/belt Lowepro system it is actually very manageable. 

The only down side is that everyone will be staring at you because you have thousands of dollars of camera equipment strapped to your body. But if you can overlook that, this is the way to go. I have used this system at many zoos without ever having problems, in fact just unzipping a single lens and switching seems safer to me than opening an entire bag of equipment every time you want to switch lenses. Many of the cases also come with a built in rain/snow cover so if the weather changes all of your equipment is not destroyed. You can also put just a few pouches on a normal belt when you are just going to take photos in the back yard or don't need to take all of your equipment, which is nice. I really can't say enough about how much easier this makes traveling with a lot of equipment, if you have been hopelessly searching for a better solution, consider this, you won't regret it.

Once you get this remote working -- which I found challenging, and I work with computers all day long -- you'll definitely like how it works and it's better than programming in codes. The biggest problem is the charging dock doesn't make a connection to the remote so you have to wiggle the remote or put a book on top of it to make sure it touches down on the charging contacts, which means it's usually dead when I go to pick it up. I've been on hold for over an hour to try to get them to help me with this issue once again which BOTH of my 880s have, and they're not even answering. Last time I called, they said many people were having the same problem and all I had to do was squeeze a rolled-up piece of paper behind the battery to force that connection. That solution hasn't worked. They're on to something, but I'd wait for a version where they've addresed this issue

Overall this is a very good remote.  It replaced 5 of my remotes, which is all except my Bose, which is RF controlled.  It even replaced my Windows Media Center Edition remote and works with my PS2 with no problems.
My negatives for this device are that the layout is a little less comfortable and intuitive than some of my other remotes and the default functions aren't necessarily the most used functions therefore requiring additional time to set-up.  These negative however are more than acceptable when you remember that it works with so many devices.  I am definitely happy with this remote and would undoubtably purchase again

Easy to use, and fairly easy to set up.  However, as stated in most previous reviews I read, initial setup may be a bit more challenging for those not comfortable with computer navigation and use.  Wish that macro creation was more detailed; for example, more detail on steps to create a customized macro to watch a DVD, including ejecting and closing the DVD tray.  Pleased with purchase

This was a breeze to set up.  Just install the software on you computer, enter the model numbers of your components.  For those few items that aren't in the list, the 880 can learn from an old remote.  As a very nice bonus, if you don't have the old remote, the software will try to pick a device (example : you have an RCA tv Model XYZ , if model XYZ isn't in the list, it might suggest ZxY)  , and that suggestion should work. 

I liked how I could create a list of favorite channels, and how I could upload icons for those channels to the remote.    So that it shows the icon instead of the number.  Or better yet.  Open the icon in paint and in the icon put the number (the channel number right in/on the icon).  It looks good and works great!

I love how the database for the IR codes for all the different devices can be added to by the users of the remote.  I understand that no company could ever hope to have ALL of the IR codes for ALL devices ever made.  To think that a company could do that would be insane.  Logitech realized there is power in numbers.  Let the end users help to improve things.  

It also allows you to leave any components on permanently, for example my TIVO box.  I don't want that to turn off.  It can be turned off, and as a default the Harmony 880 will turn it off (to save power).  I prefer it on.  And making that change was pretty simple, you just go into the preferences for the TIVO (in the harmony software), and tell it "Always leave this device on".  Now when you hit the off button on the harmony remote, everything else turns off and the harmony 880 leave the TIVO on.

My only complaints are these items: The buttons to the left and right of the screen are a little tough to push.   I personally think they should have been a little easier to activate.  Also I would have liked to have had the pause button a little more centered and more separated from the other buttons.  That way it would have been easier to pause a tv show/dvd/vcr tape.  

And last but not least the Media and Device buttons should have been separated more from the left and right arrows that are just above those buttons.  It's a little tough to hit them without thinking about what you are doing.

Given to have made the improvements I have just said would require adding a little width to the remote, but the trade off would have been for the better.  

All in all I suggest the remote for anyone who has a number of components for their home theater.  It works wonders.  It might just be that I am a little to picky on my technology.

I was a bit skeptical about this purchase, although I previously owned one of the first Harmony remotes in pre-Logitech days and was very pleased with it. Some of the reviews were a bit off-putting, particularly about the 890 with its RF option, so I went for the 880 and I am glad I did. Despite comments from others the on-line programming was superb - all my components were already in the database.  Certainly I was very familiar with the process having programmed my first remote through 3 evolutions of components before selling it with the total package.  In any event the process was hassle free and I  now have a fully integrated control for my Replay TV, Cable box, TV, Receiver, DVD and VCR just as I had hoped for. The control process is seamless, and provided you realize that the remote is sending a stream of IR commands and needs to be kept pointed at the system until the remote tells you the command is complete all works great.  (The fact the remote tells you to keep pointing at the system is a great improvement over my prior unit.)  My only slight critique is that the remote does NOT have a similar prompt when you switch off so you can inadvertently move the remote too quickly and leave something on that should be off.  However the Help process can quickly resolve this when you switch on again.  The rechargeable batteries are a good innovation too - I have had no problem locating the unit on the charging base.  Overall I thoroughly recommend the 880.

If you have basic PC skills this remote is for you.  With its USB connection you can basically make any button you want anywhere you want it. The small LCD screen is very easy to set up and you. If your to lazy to customize your remote(me), it also has a learning port.  The learning port is as easy as pointing your old remote at your new one.  My favorite feature is turning everything on.  The button "Play DVD" turns on the dvd player suround sound and tv, additionally it sets the inputs to the proper settings so your dont have to pres tv/video.  The only problem that I have with this remote is the recharge base.  It sits on it so light that sometimes it gets bumbed on/off and gives off a beep.  All in all this is probably the best remote ive  ever had

Great remote, does evertying I hoped and dreamed. The only downside was the set-up. Logitech went to great lenths to make the set up as simple as possible - unfortunatly that made the fine tuning of the remote a long process navigating a large number of learning steps. In the end I am very happy with the product and would suggest it to anyone - just put aside some time to get it to work exactly how you wish

This was everything I looked for in an mp3 player, but only for about first 6 months.  About half a year from getting it the headphone input went, making the audio staticy and constantly going mono.  Had to send it in for repairs.  After another 5-6 months of light use (mostly in the car, so it's not like it was bumped around in bags and pockets) the problem reoccurred.  Had to send it for repairs again.  A couple of months later, after the 1 year warranty expired, I noticed that the battery life started to decrease.  In a few weeks it got to a point of lasting for only about an hour after being fully charged.  I nevertheless continued using the unit, being extra careful with that damn headphone jack and making sure that I charge it every night.  So a couple of weeks ago (about 15 months after purchase) it stopped working completely.  When turned on it gives "HDD Error" message .  Resetting does not work.  The computer no longer "sees" it when it's plugged in. I emailed tech support and got and they said that it looks like the hard drive needs to be replaced and the possible cost for that is $195.  Needless to say that I won't be investing two hundred bucks into the clearly faulty unit.  I really liked it before the problems started and was eventually planning to upgrade to 60GB model, but I doubt I'll trust this manufacturer again

I had an iPod for about a year, and had a lot of problems with it, having to get it replaced twice before my warranty expired.  After the third time, I sold it to a friend and invested in the iAudio instead.  This is a great product, as it can record sound, play movies, radio, and play tons of file formats.

I highly reccomend this product, especially over the iPod...they are crap compared to this.  The only minor downside is that you will have to download a program that converts m4p files (songs from iTunes if you purchase music from them) as the iAudio can't read m4a or m4p.  It's easy enough to get a converter, just might cost you a little more money.

Outstanding use of my money though....thumbs up

I bought this player in December 2005,since then , this beautiful piece of technology has been working extremely well.
I have no complaint about it, because I'm extremely dependent of this player, so that means that i use it, around 5 hours in my days off,and  2 hours in a regular day.Another example of how durable  this player is, because I like to exercise(running) with the music as my main power��, therefore with the really hard to find function(anti-shock) in portable hard drives, the iaudio x5 is one the most functional PMP on the market.
About the sound is just incredible clear with the right earphones.the unique complaint is about the non-sync with WMP,so I'm still waiting the right firmware... 
 As a conclusion cowon almost has my complete faith in their products.

I bought my X5 in early October of 2005 and after about 6 months its been nothing but problems. In under a year I have sent it back to them twice and I am about to do so for a third time. The problem is with the volume, it goes from low to loud randomly. The volume problem appears to be a defect with the X5 itself. I know this because two of my friends deceided to buy it when they saw mine and they have both had the same problem. The difference is that they got tired of sending it back and to be honest with you if they can't fix it this time I won't either. I think I'll be done with this company. When you read all the things the X5 can do it sounds great on paper and it would be a great MP3 Player but it rarely works

When I started looking for an mp3 player my main concern was the ability to play songs at a very high quality level. The ipod was a consideration, as was another top rated Sony mp3 player. However, I  didn't want to get what everyone else had and after a bad experience with an unnamed sony game console, I thought I would try something new. If you asked ten people who Cowon was, I would say probably nine of the ten couldn't tell you. It is very sturdy and has the same general shape/dimensions as the ipod. Clearly designed to compete with Apple, the iAudio X5 has some very valuable aspects:

-Superb sound quality, especially from something that weighs under 8 oz. (I am currently using full size stereo headphones because they are more comfortable)
-Rugged all metal construction and overall great feel
-Simple design and intuitive joystick/buttons (I found the joystick to be quite easy to use after about 10 minutes; converts from the iPod may take some getting used to)
-A plethera of options: mach3 bass, surround sound, pan, wallpaper, 5 band equalizer, fm radio, voice recorder, surround sound and MP enhance
-The ability to play video
-A 14 hour battery with a 3 hour charge time
-Very powerful, I normally listen at level 20 or less of the 40 volume levels on it
-Priced about the same as equal or lesser mp3 players
-Extremely easy program to use for transferring ANY type of file to the iAudio. It is a drag and drop system; it took me about seven minutes to transfer all of my 3.5 gigs of music.
-Everything you need is included in the box - earphones, usb 2.0 transfer cable, another cable, a 4 port attachment for the bottom of the player, charger and jetshell software
-Great storage space (20 GB) which can be used to store much more than mp3s 

There are some negative attributes to the iAudio X5 however:

-The most glaring problem I had was with the in-ear headphones; they did not fit all the way in and were more than uncomfortable. They also have an assymetrical length cord. I consider myself to have average size ear canals so I imagine this is a major problem for other users. I suggest Cowon completely redesigns these.
-Because the brand is widely unknown, the price may scare some away even with all the features and reviews. 
-No place online to buy mp3s particulary for this player (however I read somewhere that there would soon be one just like iTunes.)

This being my first mp3 player I am extremely happy with the purchase even for the price, because I would rather pay more for the quality. The iAudio X5 is an all around outstanding media player and I believe will start to make a name for itself once the word gets out. If I were to rate everything that came in the box I would give it a 9.5 out of 10 because of the earphones. Other than that this mp3 player is close to perfect.

I've had this MP3 since Xmas 05. It gave me trouble initially then the problem went away. Since July it hasn't worked for more than a few hours, despite Cowon's several attempts to fix it. This is the third, or maybe now it's the 4th?, time that the sound on my 20 GB iAudio X5 has cut out. Cowon just returned it to me again a couple of weeks or so ago. The screen shows that the song is playing - it's just that no sound comes out. Besides this problem it also has an annoying problem of repeating songs when the setting is set not to repeat.  This is a quibble, however, that one can live with.  Given the problems I'm having with it I considered rating it a 1 star except that when the sound does work it is really good.

After doing a fair amount of Internet research about MP3 players and their features I was under the impression that I would go with an iPod.  Having been in the computer industry for almost 15 years I have never been fond of the Mac and have always been a little biased towards PC's.  This added to my reticence to own a Mac product and the growing complaints about service on the iPod being a 'bit' over priced I forged on.

I started reading through all of the reviews I could find on the Internet and as always, found a wealth of them here on Amazon.  To my dismay all the reviews I could find on product names I knew absolutely trashed the products they were reviewing which scared me immensely.  Thats is, until I got to the iAudio line.  The reviews were almost all positive and the complaints that were present were things I could easily overlook.  I love the control, I am big guy with big hands and I have rarely, if ever, pushed the control and not had the result I was intending.

I have had my iAudio X5 for over a month and I have nothing bad to say in the least.  I am an avid Linux user and it works flawlessly with Linux, the sound quality is phenomenal, except the ear buds that came with mine have a lot of static in them so get rid of those.  The FM tuner is great (you wont get that on an iPod).  I travel a lot and I pipe my X5 through my car stereo using a cassette tape converter plugged into the stereo out port.

What else can I say, this is a great product with great features and it looks good too!  I also bought a case from zCover which fits the purpose but I think that as time goes on some better more versatile cases will come to market.

I, like many other people that have written reviews here, researched the purchase of an MP3 player in great detail.  Other members of my family own iPods, and that is the direction that I was heading until I did a massive amount of research.  If you want to rip the thousands of songs that you already own on CD, this is the unit that you want.  iPod will not let you download your own songs, I did not know that until after I purchased this player (thankfully).  This unit was the highest rated unit by far that I was able to scour the internet for.  If this is your first purchase of an MP3 player (like mine) buy this one, no questions asked.  Do not worry about trying to buy $80 ear buds the sound from the ear buds that come with the player is unreal.  Crisp, clear, awsome base and I have only turned up the player to 23 on the volume it goes up to 40.  I cannot hear the home stereo that my wife is listening to or my kids that are running around the house playing.  I received this player in the mail today at 5:30 when I got home from work and by 6:35 I have transfered the 114 artists folders (about 4,000+ songs) that I had ripped on my computer last week (about 35 to 40 minutes to transfer the music to the staging folder and then to the player).

I would recomend buying the cradle, it helps in standing it up on the desk or over the stereo, which I plan to do to play all my music on my outdoor speakers by the pool.

Absolutley buy this unit.  I have only messed wit it for a couple of hours and I have a high performance expectation and it has met it

I am not going to rehash what the other comments have said.  Most that mention pros and cons are accurate.  Here is my addition.  Joystick is not as good as the Ipod.  On the other hand, the Ipod was designed by Apple and therefore needs extra software to use it with a PC.  I have not even installed any software to use my iAudio!  I use it as a hard drive, Mp3 player, and sometimes I record radio shows to listen to later.  I got the 30gb for extra storage.  The iAudio seems to be quality made and doesn't scratch as bad as my son's iPod.  I would buy this product if I had to do it all over again!

I bought this a few months back, and I use it mostly for playing WoW.

PROS: Very high quality product, strong enough to endure long keyboard-smashing combat sessions. The LCD is very useful if [like me] you enjoy playing your own music while you play a game, because it allows me to control iTunes whithout alt-tabbing out of the full-screen game. Macro keys open up a huge array of possibilites, and they are particularly helpful if you can arrange your in-game action buttons to duplicate their positioning on your keyboard (I use flexbar with WoW).

CONS: The software needs a bit of improvement: If I put my computer to hybernate, the software seems to hang when I bring it back up, and I can't use the macro keys, so I have to reboot or kill the software's process and restart it manually. The interface used to configure the macro keys lacks a bit of usability (it forces me to use the mouse a lot, and i like being able to use the keyboard). Even though the LCD offers other posibilities [like displaying available ammo], I don't use most of them, because I can get most of these values from my game's UI and I dont have to look away from the monitor to do so.

Overall a very good product if you enjoy keyboard based computer gaming. Wouldn't go back to a regular keyboard for gaming

I think there are softer keyboards, i.e. less resistance when pressing down.  God, I miss my SPAR station keyboard, but can't use it with a PC :( 
</reviewer_location>
<review_text>
Overall, this keyboard is great.  Here are what I like about it:
1.  I can fly on this key due to it's relatively soft keys (I think there are softer keyboards, i.e. less resistance when pressing down.  God, I miss my SPAR station keyboard, but can't use it with a PC :( )
2.  LCD screen has huge growth potential for other info display.
3.  lighted keys (this can be a bad thing too).
4.  Programmable keys, lots of them!  (can be a headache to remember them too)

The flaws:
1.  The lighted keys uses a bright blue color, even at the dimmest setting it's still not good.  Here's some physics for the designers:
The human eye doesn't sense blue well in the dark, and thus the pupil stays wide open, and the blue lights can be seen as a bad glare.  Same effect of having one of those expensive HID xeon headlights beaming at you.  So why is this a problem on a keyboard?  well, you would most likely use it in the dark with the key lights on.  However, your peripheral vision will have this blinding glare, it could make some people dizzy or have some optical illusion that's not going to sit well with your eye's scan rate.  Suggestion for the designer:  use other less intrusive color for the LED, possibly red, orange, green.  Hell, make them selectable!  Blue would not be my first choice.

2.  The USB plugs on this keyboard doesn't support my USB 2.0 flash drive, BAD!!!!  If you are going to provide an USB port, do it right!

3.  The black soft rubber surface on the edge and LCD back cover is a dust magnet.  They provide some good traction when you grab them, but they also grab dust like nothing else, so you'll endup with an impossible to clean black surface.  Lesson learned, don't eat snacks near the keyboard, or your keyboard will end up with lots of nice snacks for the dog to lick :D 
Ok, duck tape would fix that, but... I'm lazy!

Other than that, it's a solid keyboard

I bought this keyboard originally for the LCD screen and the wide range of possibilities that exist with programming it for various games I play.  I was suprised to learn that this is more than a pretty keyboard with an LCD hanging off of it.  It's the best-feeling keyboard I've ever owned.  The keys take just the right amount of pressure to operate, and the switch to disable the windows key is a welcome feature.  The backlighting is bright, day or night, and the programmable G-keys make executing complicated key combinations in games or business applications a thing of the past.  Highly recommended

I've had the Logitech G15 for several months now and it has many features which I use regularly. The paint doesn't seem to wear off even if I rub or scratch at the keys. Installation was somewhat time consuming because the keyboard has drivers for each part rather than one driver for the entire thing. 

Pros-
 Lights look great
 Screen is easily readable
 Third party LCD apps are highly customizable
 I can use chat on Trillian and access my buddy list with the screen. (Keystrokes go directly to the screen when you hit the button for reply, then I can send it by hitting enter)
 I can view a winamp visualization and song title, view my playlist, change various volume controls and use standard playback functions
 I can view network activity
 Macros are easy to program
 The key feel is awesome compared to my old keyboard. They have a nice solid click to them, but the pressure necessary and the keystroke length are both small. 
  

Cons-
 Included LCD apps are terrible and useless to me
 Long setup
 More G-Keys than you'll ever use
 Minimal game support
 LCD apps take up valuable RAM (although not much)
 Keyboard profiler takes up RAM and must run to maintain full functionality
 Invisible lettering when the lights are off
 Light brightness levels are pointless. The options are: Off-can't see it! 1-Visable but dim. 2-Slightly more visible but still dim.
 USB ports are USB 1.1
 "Gaming mode switch"... I never hit the windows key while gaming even though I usually use ctrl and alt frequently. I think you'd really have to be fumbling with the keys to need that feature
 The wrist rest is flimsy
 The default LCD setting is to cycle through the APPS (which I hate) and if I don't shut down properly, the LCD profiler resets all its settings to default.
 The included POP3 checker doesn't have SSL, you need to get some ridiculous add on which sucks up more resources. The mail checker APP+ the SSL thing ends up being a little too resource heavy for me to appreciate. In other words, its a big pain to get Gmail working with the included checker.

If you play a lot of World of Warcraft or really like to tweak your settings and streamline your interface, you might enjoy having all the macros. The screen is more useful for non-gaming purposes, so don't buy it with intent to improve your HL2 experience (since the LCD doesn't display anything for HL2 anyway). There are many 3rd party LCD apps out there and you can probably find one that will make you love the screen. Be warned, unless you use the 3rd party apps, you probably will be disappointed with the LCD's functionality. 

Bottom line- Recently the priced spiked up for these keyboards, I wouldn't pay the new higher price for one. This isn't the kind of item I would say that I can't live without. Its mainly a luxury, and unless you're a serious computer geek (like myself), you probably won't even know how to utilize the more advanced features.
The hardware is solid and powerful if you know how to use it. The included software cd ended up in my trash can.

This fashionable keyboard does spruce up any workstation or gaming environment compared to the typical ho-hum keyboard. The LCD screen is a nice feature (toy) but I find myself rarely using it as most apps and games don't support it. The two USB ports are very handy and would be especially so for anyone without frontside USB on their towers. It is worth buying for anyone in that situation. The blue lighting on the keys do make them easier to read in a dim room but doesn't help much in a truly dark room. The macro keys are plentiful and easy to use.

All-in-all well worth the buy for anyone wanting something that looks nicer then the typical keyboard, anyone needing easy access to USB ports and for anyone needing macro keys. People may also want to give the new Vista keyboard from Microsoft a look

We bought this TV 3 months ago and don't regret it one bit.  It was delivered right to our door in a timely manner and in perfect condition.  We do not have satellite or cable (only reg. antenna) and were very pleased to find that we get so many more channels now and much much clearer reception now that we are picking up the "digital" signals.  Again, we love it and would reccomend it to anyone wanting to move up to HD

I searched far and wide and compared many tv's.  It came down to the Panasonic Plasma TV vs. the Sony KDFE42A10.  I went with the Sony due to price; but I'm glad I did.  I can't see putting [...]in a TV.  I am really pleased with the Sony; particularly the price I paid.  It was so much cheaper here at Amazon.com than at the big box retail stores

I purchased this television at a bricks-and-mortar store, on sale, for less money than the 32" LCD screen that I was considering. I was planning to place the TV on a stand, not the wall, and I do not need the incredible viewing angle of plasma, so there was no reason to spend the extra money for the truly-flat TV.

For comparison, I am moving from a 26" CRT HDTV to this unit. The size difference is amazing, but that is to be expected by gaining more screen real estate. What surprised me is that even on 480i or 480p broadcasts, the picture is markedly better on this set than on my previous CRT. I'm honestly not sure if it's because of the size difference again (larger = more detail shows?), or because of the TV itself, but it's great.

My only real complaint is that I cannot access an on-screen guide using the TV, as the CableCARD technology is only one-way at this point. However, I will not penalize the TV's rating because the CableCARD technology is immature; that's not this TV's fault.

I, for one, actually like the thought of changing a bulb every 12-24 months in my TV. Remember: the phosphor in CRTs and plasmas will lose the ability to glow over the years, and that can't be replaced. The backlight in standard LCD screens will lose brightness and go out over time, and that can cost hundreds or thousands of dollars to replace. However, this TV only has one component for which failure is expected: the bulb, which I can replace myself in five minutes for ~$200.

My last "pro" is the TV's weight. I moved my old CRT off of the TV stand, and almost killed my back doing so. I was able to lift this TV into place with almost no effort. The entire unit weighs about 60-65 pounds, and the weight is in all the right places. Even though it's light enough to lift with ease, Sony included one final touch that I am thankful for: rubber feet. I can scoot this TV on my stand without scratching the wood surface, and when trying to center a TV which is nearly 40" wide across the front, that's a good thing

I got mine locally for $1100 dollars.  The going rate was 1399-1599.  I saw it at a competitor for $1198.  So I went to another competitor and they gave it to me for the same price and took another $100 off the price for HDTV installation.  What a picture.  I started to get turned off by sony because I had 2 32 inch CRT's with tilted yoke making widescreen movies bend at the corners.  But I remained loyal and I'm glad I did.  I was iniitally wanting a DLP by Samsung but thise one next to in the store blew it away.  I didn't go for the $500 dollar service contract because that's half of the price of the television.  I'll take my chances on this one.  Hopefully bulbs will come down too.  You'll love the picture with or without HDTV.  I love all the features and they're pretty intuitive.  There probably won't be too many left.  I think they're phasing the model out.  Not sure about amazon but the sony purchase is worth it.  Sorry about the other bad reviews here

I bought this TV in March of this year (2006) and it has worked perfectly until the Sony Techs came out and "updated" my firmware.  I was not having any problems with the TV but thought that it should be updated or possibly affect the warranty.  As soon as the tech left and I turned on the TV, the fan is running on "high" and is loud.  This did not happen until the software was updated.  I went into the functions and tried to use the High Alt function to turn the fan to low (off) but that would work.  The good news is I bought the extended warranty and will get it fixed, or replaced.........  Word of caution, you may consider not updating the firmware if the TV is working, and buy the extended warranty.  I paid $300 for 4 years and figure I'll get at least one $250 bulb out of the deal (yes, it is covered).  Otherwise, the TV is perfect

I purchased my tv in Dec 2004. I did not purchase the extended warranty. These sets are have all kinds of video problems. Myself and other LCD owners have called for in home service. The service company is QUALXSERV in home service. They want $350.00 to come to your home if you do not have the extended warranty, and can not guarantee a fix. Take it from me buy some other Bran

Well, I can't give an honest review of this product because I haven't yet received it.  I ordered it on June 15, and it was promised, by Amazon direct, not another seller via Amazon, between June 21 and June 23.  So I'm sitting here on July 15 with no TV.......
It really isn't Amazon's fault, it's the shipper, Eagle.  But whatever, I'm less than satisfied with this Amazon.com transaction.  I have seen the TV in stores and it looks good though..................

Brilliant images.  Highest quality.  You simply cannot beat this system for the price.  Also, this particular projection TV handles the non-HDTV channels very well - not all HDTV models do this.  The fact is that most channels are not available in HDTV yet, so it's nice to have a high quality TV that can deliver non-HDTV channels to you in a high quality rendering.  This TV does that very well.  Yes it's nothing like HDTV, but all the same they do a fine job with this model

The LCD is easier to use than the earlier version that relied on audio clips to switch frequency. You may have to experiment a good deal to find a position where the signal reaches the car radio adequately, like the 1960s rabbit ears tv antennas. Even then, if you are in an are with good FM radio coverage it's going to be hard to find a frequency where this will work. Mostly you can't use this with a cover on and you'll need a car charger if you want to use it for long. The all-in-one modulator and charger that clips to the docking connector is a better solution

We have the original Itrips but wanted this one for travel since it is much eaiser to tune in. The originals work great around town because it is always set on the same station. After reading the instructions I plugged the new Itrip in and it worked perfectly just like the originals. Not only did it work but it worked from 40 feet away. That is better than I expected after reading all the feedback. I'm not sure what everyones problem is. It's not a radio tower, it's a transmitter the size of your finger. I get the feeling that some people think it should power the City block.

I was a little tentative to order the iTrip LCD because of some of the bad reviews I read.  It seems like there are very few people sitting on the fence with this item.  Buyers either love it or hate it.
  
I was leaving for a trip and hoped the iTrip would arrive so I could use it on my drive.  As luck would have it, it was in my mailbox the day before I left.  I unwrapped it and went out to the vehicle to test it.
  
I plugged it into my 20GB iPod photo and right off the bat thought I had trouble.  It wouldn't power up, I tried plugging and unplugging, cleaning the contacts and finally as a last resort, read the instructions.  After plugging it in you have to play the song before it will power on.  This immediately explains why so many poeple complain of DOAs right out of the box.
  
I set the frequency to the lowest available on the FM band and presto!!! instant music.  I don't live in an extremely populated area so I can't really comment on other stations bleeding through but loud passages are loud and quiet passages are quiet.  

Many reviewers complained of bad sound quality but you must remember this.  It doesn't matter how great the quality of the song is on your iPod, you are playing it over FM radio so it will never sound better than FM radio.

  I inherited my father's '91 Accord work car when he retired and it has a bare bones AM/FM radio with a tone control(bass AND treble all rolled into one handy knob!!!) and cheap 6 1/2 inch speakers in the front doors.  When I drive I like to listen to talk radio and podcasts and occasionally music.  The sound quality was exactly what I expected, no better and no worse.  

I also tested it in my wife's '01 Focus.  It has a nice factory 6 speaker CD system and the sound from the iPod was just fine.  The bass still thumped and the highs seemed just a tiny bit off but still not bad at all.  I am completely satisfied with the product.  

One strange thing that I noticed that may explain why some people complain of bad sound quality is if you tap on the iTrip, the sound comes through your speakers much like tapping on a microphone.  If you were to lay it on a hard surface in your vehicle you could probably hear it through your speakers when encountering rough road.  

Unless there was a defective batch sent out, I don't know where all of the complaints come from.  I got mine for $15 from a private seller on Amazon and consider it a great purchase especially for that amount of money. Don't hesitate to buy one, it works as advertised and the sound quality is what it is.  If you keep these things in mind, you won't be disappointed

i was using the tape player for my ipod.  but since i got a new car which did not have a tape deck, i was forced to go to the fm transmitter.  i had expected it to be as clear as my radio, b/c afterall, it feeds off radio frequency.  i was very very disappointed.  it was full of static and depending on the position of your body and transmitter, static can increase or decrease.  i know it wasn't because i had weak radio frequency b/c the other stations were perfectly clear.  so i blame the transmitter.  i ended up returning the item 2 days after i bought it.  i'm glad target took it back.

Some people seem to have had issues but I loved mine. I live in the Boston area and the iTrip always worked fine in the 88.3-88.5 range. Not fantastic sound but more than adequate. The portability is a huge plus as well - I used it for playing my iPod over radios in hotel rooms when traveling, radios at friends' houses, on and on.  The iTrip is considerably more useful than a tape player adaptor and far more reliable. I have never found a tape player adaptor that worked well consistently.

For the price and the convenience you can't beat this thing.

The only drawback is that it will not work with the newer generation of iPods

I purchased 1 of the old model when I bought my ipod. As hard as I tried I was unable to switch stations on it. "Okay" I thought, "I must have got the one bad one..." So I called Griffin and they were not much help. They said that the "radio stations" may have been bad and said I would need to down load new software. Well no luck it still didn't work and the one station I could get sounded like horrible - when it worked at all. So then I saw the new version out on the market. So I figured I'd upgrade to one that looked easier to use. I bought 2 of them - 1 for me and 1 for my wife. Neither one sounds any good. I can recieve a radio station 40 miles away with no problem but I can't hear my ipod from 4 feet away. Both of them sound exactly the same. They constantly sound fuzzy like they are "just not tuned in right" If you turn up the volume on the ipod to boost the power to the Itrip then the sound distorts before the "station fuzz" goes away. Only a fool walks on thin ice twice - and I've done it 3 times now...Never again! Don't follow in my footsteps! Please take my advice and do not waste you money on this garbage

or probably another piece of Sony equipment
</reviewer_location>
<review_text>
I have had this system for 9 monthis now, and I am sure this is the worst piece of AV equipment I have ever owned.  Sony is usually known for quality products, but it this case I am afraid they rested on their laurels and delivered a poorly designed and poorly manufactured piece of equipment to the market.

The worst part is that I have had numerous problems with it.  Occasionaly it fails to recognize CD/DVD inserted after you turn it off and back on.  On other occasions it completely locks up.  The first time it happened I had to call Sony customer support and find out the secret combination of buttons to press to unlock it. Now, after about 9 months of use, it has taken on a habit of completely shutting down with a message "PROTECT UNPLUG".   The only way to bring it back to life is to unplug it and plug it back in after a few minutes.  There is nothing wrong with my electric wiring -- I have checked, and the system is plugged into a fairly expensive surge protector/power conditioner.  I am not sure whether to go through the trouble of fixing it -- at this point it's just not worth it because of all the other things I despise about this system.  

First off, CDs and DVDs take forever to load.  To insert a disk one has to press an "Eject" button and then listen carefully for about two minutes while the system rearranges itself and lets you finally insert the disk.  If you missed your chance -- tough luck, start all over.  Second, it is a royal pain to use -- any configuration apart from the basic settings is as convoluted as it can possbly be.  On screen menus, a standard on most systems, now do not exist, and the manual is a joke. Third, the FM radio is awful.  I went out and spent money on an expensive FM antenna -- still, my cheap clock radio gets better reception.  Fourth, there are other annoying little things about this system which are too numerous to list in this review.  

Finally, I don't share people's opinion that the sound is all that great.  It's average.  Out-of-the-box it is way too heavy on bass.  The wireless feature is nice -- I admit, and that was the reason I bought it.  But I would not buy it again (or probably another piece of Sony equipment) in a million years now.  I could live with wires running around my room, or even just a two-speaker system rather than deal with this piece of junk. Shame on Sony for slapping their name on this lemon.

I bought this "dream system" to compliment my Samsung HL-R5087W 50" HDTV DLP television.  If looks could kill these two products together win hands down.  Overall I am pleased with the system for the amount of money I invested for it.  Sound is decent.  I feel it is diffidently a great acoustic system but if you are looking for the bass invest in a wired system with Monster Cables.  As like many others thoughts I was attempting to overcome an apartment predicament and "wireless" seemed to be the answer.  Problem is the two rear speakers still need to be connected to each other via none other then a WIRE.  So if you are looking for a truly wireless gig continue to hold your breath because Sony has figured out how to eliminate point A to point B but point B to point C remain dreamless

This is a great piece of hardware, the wireless rear speakers was a big selling point for me. But in my apartment I would like to have more control over the subwoofer speaker, it's volume slider is hidden in a settings menu there is no separate knob for it on the speaker itself. The bass sound from subwooferis overbearing at default. The other thing is that I would like to be able to have better control over the sound itself with an equalizer. That's not going to happen with this system, you can't change that easily. And yes the 5 disk changer is slow. The maximum volume setting doesn't seem that loud to me, but then I have the decibal settings at default. All the sound quality you expect from a theater system is here, it has all the flavors. Hooking it up to an xbox directly didnt work the way I'd like it too, but I only tried RCA and not the digital. I have a sony 32" Wega and I had the xbox patch to it and then routed to the DAV-FX100 reciever. That works like a charm, even with 5.1 sound from XBOX. One huge complaint I have is the shielding for the mid and left and right front speakers are not the best. I see a bit of haze from the magnetic fields from both the front 3 speakers, even had to elevate my center channel for fear that would permanently damage the tube on my TV. There is mention of this problem in the manual but that should be on the front page not the middle of the manual! Beware! Four Stars

I started searching for wireless surround speakers due to the configuration of my apartment. A wired solution simply would not work due to the location of my couch and the distance from my TV. After searching for a while, there were only a couple options available: the Sony DAV-FX100W, a system by Panasonic that had an optional wireless option, and a wireless receiver kit made by Kenwood. After looking at reviews of all of the different options, the Sony DAV-FX100W appeared like the best choice. I'm very happy with that decision. DVDs look great on my HDTV with the 1080i upscaling feature. Be forewarned, if you wish to use this feature you will need to purchase a very expensive HDMI cable and your TV will need to be support it. I bought a 3ft Belkin cable (instead of Monster) and it was still over $100. DVDs also sound terrific; the surround is impressive for a wireless solution. Like any stereo, it is important to adjust to levels for each speaker, and I pumped up the surround speakers a little as well as the center channel. The subwoofer, as others have stated, is pretty powerful for a passive speaker. There could be more depth to the sound, however, it is an out of the box solution and I think it sounds good enough as long as the standard output is kept at it's default sound level. Others have complained that CDs don't sound good; I disagree. I've played several CDs and I think they sound great. I also input my iPod through the Video1 audio inputs, and that sounds pretty great too. Again, like any receive, you'll need to play with the settings and audio fields to enhance the sound to your liking. Overall, I'm very happy with this system

I purchased the Sony DAV-FX100W system over the internet.  It surprisingly arrived in only a few days. Assembly and wiring instructions were done well.  It looks good and matches well with my Sony HDTV.  
The sound quality is just fine for movies and TV programs but fair at best for listening to music on CD's or from the FM tuner and compares to an inexpensive stereo.  The base is not tight and kind of whoompy, although there is plenty of it.  I actually had to decrease it by 3 db.  The many sound stages are remarkably different and have a true sense of being there such as the "sport" which does sound like being in a stadium.  Most of the time it is best in "auto" performing in the method the audio was recorded.  
The IR transmitter/receiver works well but there are still plenty of wires for the rear speakers such as AC power for the amp, a wire from the IR receive to the amp, and wires from the amp to both rear speakers.  Not as clean as one might imagine from the product description.  
As mentioned in previous reviews, the 5 disk changer is very slow and rather tricky to insert a disk until you get the knack.  A 5 disk change is not necessary as the system would probably be used with DVD's for watching movies as opposed to inserting multiple CD's to listen for music.  I certainly would prefer my stereo for that!
Over all I am satisfied with it and recommend it.  It performs well for what it was intended, to reproduce sound from movies and TV.  Again it is a good looking system.

Well, I ended up buying mine on closeout from Radio Shack for $149..
I love mine... The sound really is great, and the price was AWESOME!  I use mine for DVD's, my TV's regular sound for all TV I watch, and also as a Tuner to listen to the radio/ CD's in surround sound.  
Some buyers talked about a whine from the speakers...  I don't know if this helps or not, but I will share- I had extra wire bundled up from the speakers and I did NOT put all that wire anywhere near the speakers or the head unit.  I thought that bundle of wire near a speaker might cause interference, so if you have that whine, make sure the extra wire is not near the equipment.  Mine does not make any noise on standby, or skip at all either.  I am very happy with mine.

I have owned this system since March...the sound is wonderful...definetly a great value for the money...the bass could be just a little stronger and the rear speakers aren't used as much as I thought they would be, but it is the best sound you will find for this kind of money...music sounds great, dvd is fine for the most part, no serious problems but progressive scan does act up from time to time, recycling the power corrects the problem...it will also plays cd's that I burn off my computer which is more than my kizillion dollar sony will do...and unless you are a sound snob, this system will work fine for you...and if you are a sound snob, why are you even considering this one...go for the bose system for 800.00 cause this one can't compar

The sound on this system is really fantastic for the price, but I've had the same experience as the other reviewer.  The DVD skips constantly, and Phillips is absolutely no help in fixing the problem.  Amazon has been great and has offered to give a 50% credit, but Phillips insists that I send (at my own expense) the machine to them and then wait 4+ weeks to have a 'possibly' refurbished unit.  I'm quite disappointed with Phillips and its lack of customer service

This system is quite sleek, easy to fit in a cluttered living room.  Assembly takes about two minutes.  The instructions are very clear.  The sound is amazing, especially when you put on your favorite loud, bass-heavy film.  Why then do I give it one star?

It skips.  Like nobody's business.  At first, my wife and I thought it was the disks we were putting in as many of them were scratched.  But then we put in new disks.  No difference.  When exactly does it skip?  Impossible to tell.  Sometimes a little.  Sometimes every frame!  Sometimes it'll tell us that disks are bad.  Then the next time we put them in they magically work -- until they skip.

So I called Philips and they said that not only would we have to pay for shipping, but they could not guarantee that they would fix it, and it would take up to a month before they'd ship it back.

Save your money!  Buy from someone else

I puchased this system a few days ago and am quite pleased with its performance. The DVD playback is fantastic - you really feel the surround sound - and the speakers work well. It can get pretty loud too.

The only minor issue I have is when I'm in "TV" mode the sound coming out of the rear speakers is pretty low. I've experiemented with all of the modes but can't seem to be able to get them up to the volume I would like. This is not a problem when playing a DVD or using the radio tuner, however.

Set up was extremely easy and a complete "no-brainer".

Great system for a great price

Ok, I got this as gift so I got nothing to lose right!  Well, this little gadget will be my first open door to the ipod world and i gotta say that it really gives me an awsome impression toward what apple has accomplished for ipod shuffle.
Ever since I unpacked this little thing, it has been with me everywhere!  On the go, exercise, sleeping....anywhere you have pockets to put it, ipod shuffle is always with me whenever I needed some kick of tunes, its ultra light and portability has really achieved what it meant to accomplish in the first place and talking about 1 GB of stores mp3 for about 16 hrs of playtime, it is just too hard not to fall in love with this little part of me...lol!  Sound quality is decent too and it is quite easy to charge and transfer/update tunes on the go.  So if you are a fast paced, mobile and not a control freak, then ipod shuffle is definitely a good way to get giggy with it

The iPod shuffle is nowhere near as reliable as the other iPods. I've had one break on me, and my new one doesn't work on the "shuffle" setting when listening to podcasts -- what I use my shuffle for.

On the other hand, the full-sized iPods don't do the things I need a shuffle for -- mainly, be really, really small and pretty indestructable. However, I haven't tried out any of the new generation of iPods, so they may solve one or both of these difficulties

I got my first iPod Shuffle about a year ago (8/05).  It lasted til the following May, and then started to act weird.  The lights would flash, and it would crash my computer, but wouldn't play music.  Took it to the Apple store, they said bad flash memory was the culprit and replaced it under warranty.  The new unit lasted a few months, and then it also bit the dust, in the exact same fashion as the first one.  I'm gentle on my iPod, never dropped it, left in the hot car, etc...and yet they both have died on me.  

I'd recommend the Creative Zen Nano.  It's cheaper, much easier to add songs to (no iTunes required), and has a small screen that makes it more navigable, not to mention an integrated voice recorder and FM tuner.

This printer produces 4X6 prints on postcard paper that look like they came from a photo lab.  The quality is fantastic, and the relatives were in awe.  I am very very happy with the printer and the Canon S400 camera I use it with.  I now have a portable print studio.  Do not confuse this printer with ink jet printers.  It uses dye sublimation, a completely different printing process.  The result is something that looks and feels like a glossy photo postcard, not a piece of paper.  You don't put ink in it, so there is no ink to jam your print nozzles since neither exist in this printer.  You buy the equivalent of ink and paper in kits made from Canon.  (KP-36IP, for example

This printer was very easy to use.  Just pop in the cartridge, paper, and plug in the camera.  The camera has to be a certain type of Canon, but there is an available computer cable (I have not gotten it yet), to hook up other cameras.  The benefit of using a Canon camera with this printer is you can travel without a computer, and still print out pictures.  These pictures look beautiful, and the colors are true and bright.  Printing couldn't be easier and fast.  I was able to get a print while my 2 year old was frantically trying to pull the plugs, press the buttons and all arms and legs struggling.  It's fun watching the three colors slide in and out in the three passes the printer makes to process the picture.  Instant gratification

If you own a Canon digital camera this printer is great.  It is portable and makes great prints.  People think they are from a photolab.  It is also vey easy to use.  I have seen other mini printers from Olympus and Sony and they are not as good.  They cost more too

This is very well designed. It give you 4 USB Port but two on opposite sides. This is very clever becase you have plug in devices from both sides. You webcam or cell on your left and your mouse and number pad on your right. The cord that plug in from the Hub to the Computer is very sterdy yet flexible so you can not only adjust the Hub in all kind of angles, it would stay at that angle and not twist all around you wires. It also works great if you jsut want to charge you USB devices on the go. It come with a plug in AC adapter so you don't need to bring your computer along with you to charge youd devices

This review pertains specifically to the Targus PAUH217U 4 Port Ultra Mini USB 2.0 Hub. 
The cord is about 2.5 feet long - long enough to reach from my pc, which sits on the ground, to the top of the desk. It has a cable which is split into two USB plugs - one just to transmit data, the second to power the unit. The second plug does not need to be used unless you plan on using some heavy-duty hardware, and if so what are you buying a hub called the ultra mini for anyways? If you insist on trying to run a blow dryer off the thing, then it does have an input for a separate power source, which you will have to buy separately. 

In short, If you have an old school machine with USB ports which are inaccessible /inconvenient to use, this little hub will give you quick access while taking up minimal space on your desk

I would like to believe that this hub works well- but I wouldn't know.  I bought it to reduce clutter on my desk from all my devices hooking into my powermac.  I hooked up my printer, ipod and digital camera and nothing happened.  I called Targus and they said I needed an a/c adaptor.  It doesn't come with one and doesn't say anything about one in the manual or instructions, or their website.  They said I could get it at radio shack and gave me the info (5 volt, 2.1 amp, center positive).  I've been to two radio shacks and online- they don't carry it.  I'm upset.  Any advice

It's speedy and space saving and inexpensive. I bought this to replace my Belkin because the Belkin needed to be plugged in. This one is powered by your computer so there's no extra power cords, which is a big plus to me. 

The only thing I dislike about this is the fact that the Hub takes up two Usb ports instead of just one like the Belkin.

PROS

Small
Cute
Self-powered - comes with a power adaptor.  I have 6 devices hooked up to it, including 2 USB Hard Drives, and it works fine without the adapter - a big plus for me. Most hubs would not work with this setup.
USB 2.0 & 1.1 - 6 devices hooked up, 3 low speed and 3 high speed, all work very well.
Runs cool.

CONS

Not sure why, but they put the 7 ports on one side of the hub and power/uplink ports on the other.  This is dumb.  If you have the hub on a desk it looks awkward.  All ports should be on the back and leds on the front.  Here, the leds are next to each port which makes them completely useless as you don't see them.  
The hub is very light so when you have lots of devices hooked up the font gets a elevated.

Overall, the best hub I've ever had and I tried many

You will appreciate this product only if you don't have enough USB ports. In my case, I had plenty of ports, but needed an extension cable, which would help me in plugging the flash drives, whithout bending down and plunging into the cave of wires(I keep my CPU, under the table).The only complaint I have is the the wire lenght is not long enough.
Overall good value for price

I recently purchased this as a replacement for my Monster Cable.  I must say that I am quite impressed.  This is the best FM transmitter I have encountered.

I live in Seattle.  There is a fairly saturated FM dial, and the unique topography of the surrounding area has a tendency to deflect certain signals.  That said, I only have minor problems with interference, the most common of which is moderate distortion in the upper ranges.

Functionality is pretty much seamless in my car.  I drive a 2003 Ford Focus.  The 12v power jack is position to the left of my in dash CD changer, so accessibility is not an issue.

If anyone is in the market for an FM transmitter for their iPod, I highly recommend this one.  "That'll do, pig.  That'll do.

Recieved as a present from my wife, poor girl got sold on this thing at Circuit City. Anyway, it was alright...pretty average transmitter. The thing broke immediately after it's 3 month warranty expired. I contacted DLO's customer service and they were rude as heck. I understand the thing is off of warranty but they were no help at all, wouldn't even offer to fix it if I covered the costs. So basically I have a useless piece of plastic and electronics. I bought a Monster iCarPlay and have loved it. It's put together much better, better sound, no annoying little issues, and a more reputable company. Don't spend your hard earned money on DLO...get something that will last.

I have been using this transmitter with my IPOD photo for a few days. This stuff work flawlessly and the transmission was strong enough. I tune the same radio frequency from another car and the sound still clear enough. If there was an interference, all I have to do just re-setup to the empty channel. This stuff will overpowering the other channel if available. The only drawback for me is once you plug the arm connector to the transmitter, it will hard to re-open again. It might broke the plastic construction if you are not careful.

I tried two different devices before this one, and they simply did not work satisfactorily in a big city with a very crowed FM band.

DLO Transpond is excellent, I drive through Sao Paulo, Brazil which is a huge city with almost 20 million habitants and consequently many FM stations in the dial. Occasionally I need to switch station but most of the time the same works fine all day long wherever I have to drive.
Mounting was simply, I use the extension arm provided to get a handy and firm location.
In short, I am totally satisfied.

The DLO transpod works perfectly with no static.  I was hesitant to purchase this.  I thought because it works through the radio, there would be some interference or static.  Well, I was wrong and pleasantly surprised.  I was so pleased with this product, I purchased one for my husband, and my sister and two friends bought one too.  For anyone who has an ipod, this is a must have!  Another great feature is that the transpod charges your ipod while you are listening to it.  I have NEVER needed to charge my ipod.  You can set this up any way you want it in your vehicle.  It takes up very little space.  This product is definitely money well spent, and I highly recommend it to anyone with an ipod

Application is dual input from cable TV input and analog PC input, used as side monitor on a triple screen home computer workstation.

1) Audio output stops intermittently a few times a week, requiring power off/on to regain audio.

2) There appears to be no way to disable unused source modes.  To switch from computer input to TV input requires one push of the Source button...... but then to return to computer input requires 4 button pushes - as the TV cycles thru AV, S-Video, Component modes, and finally back to PC mode.  A weak design - the unit should recognize which input is enabled - it is not possible to hook up all 5 modes.

This is particularly irritating as this model was marketed as a TV/PC monitor.

Picture quality is acceptable for the application, which is primarily watching news channels while working at PC, or displaying dual PC applications

First, I would buy it again if I needed to.  This 15" takes up less space on the kitchen counter, i.e., speakers are on the bottom. Second, picture and sound are excellent, i.e, clear.
I would not buy this item if I wanted a true VESA mount to monitor configuration.  The stand, not the monitor, has the screw holes for the VESA wall mount.  Not enough or clear info in the description. However, it is just as easy to turn on the counter as on the wall.  If you need counter space then buy something else.

Maybe if these were high end rechargable NiMH this would be a reasonable price. But for Alkaline? This is even more ridiculus than the cables they sell. You can find AAA battieries on Amazon for a third of this price

While I am pleased with the quality of sound this system gives me, I am a little disappointed. I've had this thing for a couple years now, about 9 months in it stopped giving me sound. So I went back and replaced it. They didn't even ask what the problem was, they gave no arguement because they had had so many returns and replacements. Then over the past few months the DVD player has been making a pretty loud noise whenever I use it, I have to turn the volume up pretty high just to not hear it. And now the player has stopped working completely. I have a DVD in there that I can't get out (which for the record is part of a Sopranos season, they dont sell the discs seperatly and their seasons are expensive which is pretty annoying to replace). Bose failed me once, shame on them. They failed me twice, shame on me. I'm gonna go with something else

For those who expect true 5.1 Dolby Surround out of the Bose 3-2-1 system, please look elsewhere. This unit does well in projecting sound when you have the speakers at a good ear level height for your sitting area. You need to get the setting just right for it to work anywhere close to as advertised.

I bought this system probably a month or two after it came out, maybe 4 or 5 years ago and it's still going strong. I owned an apartment and wasn't to keen on marring the walls with multiple speakers for a 5.1 system or running a plethora of cable around the living room and mounting every speaker on a stand, so this system fit the bill quite nicely. Did I know I wasn't really going to get a spectacular surround sound experience? Of course I did.

The big drawback to this system is really the lack of Component Video. I only wish it had Component Video but it was put out too early and then of course the second version came out and it had component and there I was kicking myself... and still kicking myself.

For those who complain that it doesn't play all videos, I will say this. I have also had issues with it not playing videos. What I discovered was that it wasn't the DVD's but the transfers or the video type. VCD has issues, SVCD mostly plays and of course every commercial DVD I have used has always played unless there was something wrong with the DVD itself, like it was scrached or had too many fingerprints and such on its surface. Bottom line is that when I keep my DVD's clean, my Bose system is friendly. 

If you've got bootleg DVD's, don't expect them to play in your Bose DVD, they probably won't work. More to the point, they probably shouldn't work becuase you shouldn't buy bootlegs anyway

Having owned this system now for a couple of years I have had my ups and downs but overall I am pretty happy with it. For the price you are getting a system that produces excellent clarity of sound with very small speakers. Yeah! On the negative, I don't really understand why they skimp out on the DVD side of things- I mean my $200 pioneer handles the range of DVD's much better. Of greatest concern for me though has been voice re-production. Voices are generally much softer than the other types of sounds, and while bose has a setting to try to rectify this problem, it doesn't do a very good job. Consequently, it can be difficult to hear words when watching tv and DVD's. Also, just a small note, to get the surround sound effect you have to turn the machine up pretty loud (so if you don't care too much for neighbours that won't be a problem). Overall, my music sounds crisp and I love hearing every little noise in my music, so I still have a smile on my face.

SELLER'S: For an honest review go to the CORRECT page for the Bose 321 Graphite w/ Accoustimass 3rd module and two satellite speakers.  That will have the correct retail rate and draw the true end-buyers/purchasers.  This price of $700 is for the 2 speaker satellite system so you would be losing a bit selling here.  I hope this helped you in your endeavors and I look forward to honestly/fairly competing with you in the future!

BUYER'S: Buy as many of these as you can and report any loss or "mistakes" on the sellers' part in contractual agreements to Amazon customer service.  Because if this ad by that company/seller is being honest and selling a 3 speaker system (2 satellite and 1 lrg Acoustimass) you are in for a steal! literally, so get a goin! Lol

Disclaimer: this review is an anti-review posted to make aware the disparity between price and item description (which is it?? 2 speakers or 3???) in this advertisement for above mentioned product.  Why isn't BOSE listed as a seller?! DOH  No slander or libel has ever been implied or attempted unless it was true

I don't dispute that Bose is a leader in speaker technology.  But there is a reason this item is discontinued.  It locks up when playing certain DVDs.  Sometimes after selecting "play movie" it won't get past the menu, you have to guide it to the first chapter or else it will sit endlessly on the menu screen.

Other DVDs will play fine, but if you happen to shut off the system without removing the DVD, the next time you turn it on it will say "Bad Disc" and locks up - you can't play, you can't eject, nothing.  You have to UNPLUG it and essentially reboot the system.

Maybe I got the lemon, I don't know.  But it's worth writing a review given the fairly expensive price tag and the assumed quality the goes along with the name Bose... this system is definitely an exception to that rule

I bought this 18 months ago and while I had some problems with the set up, I got help from the store where I bought it.  It has really nice sound, but it has a serious problem: not once but TWICE, when my children inserted DVDs in the player they would NOT eject!  Since no one could service it locally (I went to 3 places, and each claimed they could fix it but then later admitted they couldn't since they would have had to open it up), I had to send it to Bose.  That cost a lot, plus Bose charges a minimum of about $240 (I forget the exact amount) to even look at it.  Now, the exact same thing has happened (this is the second episode)!  They say you can repair this easily but I went through the recommended procedures with a Bose technician over the phone and it didn't work.   There's NO WAY I'm sending this machine back to them; I'm getting something else!  Any recommendations?  Finally, lest you think the kids are somehow to blame, let me note that they work daily with other DVDs, CD-roms, CD players, and personal computers and have never had any problems with any of them.  I normally don't like having to pay extra for a warranty, but if you insist on getting this product, I'd recommend buying it from a place that sells it with a warranty

I live in a small home and a large 5 speaker system with sub-woofer,plus reciever and dvd/cd player was just too much. True, the 3-2-1 doesn't have a lot of the bells and whistels of a lot a less expensive systems, but the size, ease of assembly and most of all the sound was worth the initial sticker shock

Charging indicator actually works great and gave this little gadge quite a space age looking. 

Charges battery pretty fast although not like the fastest 15-minutes charger I used. but those chargers could make battery over heat constantly. 

The build of the charger however is a little bit on the weak side. compare to the one I previously owned. 

Generally, well worth the money.  GOOD BUY!

You can never ask for more from this product. 2700maH. That's huge. Runs my discman for weeks (I roughly listen 1 hr everyday). 

The digital display is very good and accurate. The refresh feature is what makes it different from other similar products. Now forget about the "memory" bug in your battery.

Given the price, it is worth your while

Overall a very nice charger, though recharge times aren't even close to what is advertised.  The display is very nice as is the ability to charge individual batteries instead of having to do it in a pair.  The 900 mAH hold such a small charge that they are almost worthless.

This is the second Wacom tablet I own and the third tablet in general. The other wacom is the 9 x 12. Which, at the time, I thought was the greatest. And the Hyperpen (my first tablet for a starving artist)... well, don't. Don't buy it. Stay away. Horrid thing. Save up and get a small wacom.

With the purchase of my 6 x 11 i realized that it just feels right. The size is not so large it becomes unmanageable but big enough to use with my dual 19 inch monitors. And, with proportional aspect ratio on it does not waste a lot of the tablet area.

The touch stripes are useful but really not necessary. Only with it sitting in your lap pushed back from the keyboard does it really offer any usability. 

The 6 x 11 is just about perfect

Having the Wacom has increased my speed and efficiency in editing pictures.  It is the best investment I have made lately in my business.  It saves my wrist from carpal tunnel and other over-use/strain problems related with high mouse useage.  I can be much more precise on my work in photoshop! I would recommend this as a tool to add to any photographers "must have list"

I bought the intuos 6x11 pen tablet couple weeks ago and I use it
almost every day so far so good, I don't expect to have any problems with it.
I used to have a small wacom graphire and I used for years then unfortunately the pen broke so now I own a new one 
the only advice I can give to you is to keep it clean, wipe it out every now and then with a wet cloth

This product is wonderful. I have had it for about a month and use it with Adobe Photoshop CS2 and Corel Painter IX and it still amazes me. In my research, I saw that many people were purchasing the 6x8 size (maybe for price), however, if you have a widescreen format monitor, like myself, you will be much happier with the 6x11. Once you are over the short learning curve, you will find you even use it over your mouse for regular computer use

Title: Intuos3 Tablet
Publisher: Wacom
Publish Date: Unknown
ISBN/Model #:  PTZ631W
Reviewer: Robert Saucier
Rating: 5 stars

In 1997, after buying a new top-of-the-line 450MHz Pentium II system, I splurged on a Wacom ArtZ II tablet.  Oh, my!  Pressure-sensitive, tilt-sensing, pointer control, assignable function pads; it was Heaven.

After a couple of years, every time I tried to use it with my primary graphics application, my computer would spontaneously reboot -- a bit counter-productive.  I watched for new drivers and new versions of my application but, as technology marched on, my beloved tablet and graphics application continued their spats.

Sadly, I disconnected the tablet and gently packed it away.  Lately, I've been feeling the pull once more, that urge to use a pen to do photo touch-ups instead of my mouse.  Miraculously, a Wacom Intuos3 6-inch by 11-inch tablet dropped, almost literally, into my lap.  Sleek, gun-metal gray, sexy -- with a comfort-grip pen (much like my coveted Pilot G2 pens) AND a mouse!  Even better, the Intuos3 comes bundled with 3 applications that show off its capabilities:  Adobe Elements 4.0, Corel Painter Essentials 3, and nik Color Efex 2.0 lE.  Heaven just got better!

The Intuos3 has over 5000 lines per inch of resolution, over twice that of the Wacom Graphire product line, and, with its USB 2 connection, there's more than enough communication bandwidth, meaning better tablet to application response.  One hesitation I have when adding a new piece of hardware is in regard to what the driver will do to my system; will it introduce instability or get along with everyone else.  The Intuos3 driver has been rock-solid in the two weeks that the tablet has been living with me.  I've used all of my "usual" programs and have had no problems at all.  The tablet has also been peacefully co-existing with two external drives, a wireless desktop receiver, a card reader, a scanner, and a printer, all riding the same USB bus.

The Intuos3 has 8 "chordable" buttons, 4 at each side of the tablet, to which keys, macros, or other actions may be assigned.  The default for each group are the usual ALT, CTRL/Command, and Shift, along with "space".  The placement of the buttons allows you to keep a grip on the tablet, holding one or more of the buttons, while tapping whatever key on the keyboard with your pen hand.  Being chordable, you can hold any or all of the buttons down for those tricky shortcuts like ALT-CTRL-S or To the side of each of the two button pads are touch strips which can be independently programmed as well.  The default setting is to scroll or depending on the context.  The ends of the strip, in keystroke mode, can be set to playback macros.  The pen, with its 1024-level pressure-sensitive stylus AND "eraser," also has a DuoSwitch.  The DuoSwitch's two positions may also be programmed.

The pen action is smooth with the default nylon nib -- there are different types of nibs to simulate different types of tactile feedback.  With the ergonomic grip, the pen is extremely comfortable to hold.  The 5-button mouse, designed to be used by either "righties" or "lefties," is not as ergonomically correct but considering the versatility, this is more than acceptable.  As with every other clickable/pressable feature associated with the Intuos3, the mouse buttons are programmable with a ridiculous number of options, although I've yet to find the "fix photo,"  "illustrate article," or even the "design website" settings.

I can see only two very minor changes that I would make to this fantastic product.  I would love to see the ability to add weight to the pen.  It is just a bit too light for my personal tastes and considering how configurable the tablet is already, this feature would be the feather on the cap to me.  The other change would be making the drawing surface transparent as it is on the Graphire (and was on the ArtZ II).  Sometimes, having the ability to trace an outline can save significant time.

For the casual home user, I would recommend the Graphire product line -- this Intuos3 model's SRP of $369 may be a bit high where a $99 entry point on the Graphire is more affordable.  For the pro-consumer or professional, however, whether doing photo editing (my primary use) or illustration, the Intuos3 line is well worth the investment.  It's great to be in Heaven again ...

I'm a cow and like most cows I use Photoshop heavily. All I can say is that I can not believe that I went as long as I did without this tool. Other reviews are not exaggerating about the night and day difference this thing makes. 
One thing about the widescreen tablet is that it works great in portrait mode. I use a 24" Dell widescreen monitor in portrait mode and I was a little worried that the tablet might not work in that configuration. Wacom definitely did their homework. 
To be honest I found it to not be that useful in 3D Max, but in Photoshop it's a WMD

Ok, if you have two monitors side by side, or a single wide-screen format, this is the way to go!  I use this tablet with the Mac G5, with full functionality, and 1024 levels of pressure from the pen to the screen.  I have used the smaller tablets from Wacom, and they work very well, but this particular product is designed and constructed VERY WELL and makes the left right monitor design a breeze to use!

Having the assignable "ExpressKeys" left and or right is really slick for repetitive
tasks.  

This model stands 5/8" high/thick, 10 and 7/8" deep (front to back), and just under 16 and 1/2" wide.  Take two late model white Mac keyboards and set them one behind the other, and that is about the footprint this item covers, (width and depth).  
So, you will need some desk space, or I have found myself using this item on my lap with the pen.  Quite comfortable!  

In any scenario, this is by far one of the greatest products you could add to have the flexibility to be creative with whatever application you use.  

Thanks Wacom

This card is not too fast but good enough for my camera... Well that means nothing to me, I don't have your camera and I could buy it for other things. There are 65 Reviews as I'm writing this, and nobody has contributed speed tests, not even estimates! The ones that don't mention speed at all might not care, but those who do should at least give approximate read/write timings. 

The easiest way to do this is by plugging the card into your high-speed card reader (not your camera or other specific device as the device can be limited in speed). Then select a bunch of image files or any other files (at least couple of hundred MB worth of files) and copy them to the card. Time this. Divide the total MB amount by the time (in seconds). And you will get approximate information of this card's Write time! Do the opposite to test the Read time. This won't be 100% exact, but if at least 2 or 3 people do this, we'll get a pretty good idea of the card's Speed capabilities

So much cheaper than buying a flash mp3 player... I've had this and other similar Sandisk memory cards for up to two years without a problem.  Have dropped them repeatedly with no loss of data.  Transfer speeds could be quicker for taking photos, but overall, a great buy, especially as it expands the capacity of my Treo 650 to five full length movies or twenty-four cds worth of music.  I only wish someone would make a  practical case that could hold multiple secure digital cards-they're so compact, I have to be careful not to misplace them.

The 2.0 GB SanDisk Cruzer Micro flash drive looked like a good deal when I saw it on display at Office Depot.  It was roomy enough for all of my data and configuration files, was rated for USB 2.0, and was reasonably priced.  My first choice would have been an larger version of the 1.0 GB Iomega I use at work, but, alas, such wasn't available.

Unfortunately, I waited too long to put the SanDisk through its paces, or I would have tried to get a refund.  As many others have remarked, it is horribly slow.  While backing up my roughly 10,000 files, I found that it was taking about a second per file -- longer for the big ones.  This translated to around four hours to complete the whole operation.

Bulk deletes take just as long to carry out.

Using my Beyond Compare file synchronization software to *read* the SanDisk and compare its contents to what was on my hard drive went reasonably fast -- until, for no obvious reason, it hung on one particular Word document this evening.  I couldn't even get my Windows XP machine to shut down without yanking the SanDisk from its slot:  the usual "safely remove hardware" operation wouldn't work.  After three attempts to read the same file, and three reboots, I tried to delete it from Windows Explorer -- and this operation hung too.  Finally I was able to do the deletion from the DOS prompt.  Just like 1985!  I then recopied the file, and now Beyond Compare can finish its work without a hitch.

But can I trust the SanDisk to deliver up my precious files when I really need them?  I dunno ....

So, it's back to the drawing board.  Maybe by now Iomega has come out with that 2.0 GB model.  As for the SanDisk, I'm reminded of that painful adage:  you get what you pay for.

Ugh

Bought this about two months ago. Never liked it for two reasons:
-The rubber cap is so easy to lose. (Guess that's why it comes with spares though.)
-Utterly slow! This is what was most uncomfortable with the drive. Yeah it's slow only with groups of small files like everyone else said. Still, it's annoying to have to zip a bunch of small files everytime before you copy them over to the drive. Then unzip when you want to use/copy them. Not practical.

And now, well, it just stopped working last week. I mean completely, for no reason. Just great. Like one day before I was going to sell it to someone else.

But I won't because I paid good money for it.  As you can see from the other reviews, the speed on this thing is pathetic, almost to the point of non-functional when it comes to many small files.  I had a small game on the drive, but it has tons of small files in the folder. It took over 10 minutes to delete a 10 mb folder... makes you wonder if SanDisk spent 10 minutes to test this thing. Stay away.. or if you really want one, buy mine please

I bought this flash drive like a month ago and it stopped working just like that! One day I plugged it in a portatil hp pc and windows explorer didn?t respond. It?s a XP sp2. 
I unplugged it and tried again with the same result, the same with the regular pc?s where I usually use this flash drive. Bottom line: money wasted. 
Being a regular costumer of sandisk, I must say im very dissapointed. The must frustating thing is that I wont get a refund because the 30 days expired. 
Besides, it comes with a cheap cover instead of the regular one (the 512 micro flash drive).
So, try some other product.

Do NOT buy this product.  It is incredibly slow, by far the slowest USB drive out of the dozen or so that I've used.  It handles small numbers of large files rather well but it immediately chokes whenever faced with a large quantity of small files.  I attempted to copy ~50MB (1500 files, 800 directories) to the disk and it took almost 30 minutes to complete the copy!  That's roughly 27K/second.  Deleting the files was painful as well, taking at least 15 minutes to delete everything.  For kicks, I popped in an old 128 MB Kingston drive and was able to copy the same set of files to it in under 30 seconds and the delete took under 15 seconds.  Bottom line is don't be fooled by the drive's small physical size, large capacity and price point: it simply doesn't perform

My opinion will probably differ from other reviewers.

This strap works well IF you have the extended battery pack installed on the camera.

As to be expected, it is quality and would be handy for those who like to keep their camera in their hand ready for action shots.

Personally, I went back to the neck strap because, if using the hand strap, the camera is tied to your hand and that hand is unusable for much of anything else without putting the camera down. If you're out roaming around, the neck strap frees your hands up, reducing your fear of dropping the camera, eliminates the possibility of setting it down for a second and having it disappear and, with the neck strap, the camera is readily available.

I have to give it a 5 star due to the fact that it does exactly what it was designed to do and quality made.

Alot Better Then Wrapping The Neck Strap Around Your Arm Or Hand...
It Really Depends On What Kind Of Photography You Do. I Shoot At Night Clubs And Weight Can Add Up. I Have A Canon Rebel XT, Hand Grip With 2 Batties, Canon 550EX Flash, And 50mm F/1.4 Or 17-40mm F/2.8
It Feels Alot Better Using The Hand Strap...

I originally bought this for my 20D with the BG-E2 batterygrip and when it arrived found that no instructions on how to safely attach it were included. After a bit of googeling I found those (in the MKIIN manual downloadable from Canons web site) and it felt pretty secure. It certainly helps when you are using larger lenses and its good value for the money. I have now upgraded to a MKIIN and have moved the strap to that body. If you find it hard to use the main dial you have probably tightened the strap too much

I bought htis accessory because I do not fancy pretty much the neckstrap. I hate to feel my neck aching after a while due to the weight of my 10D plus battery grip and lens. I rather to carry it in my hand instead. So I thought this handstrap would give me the extra safety feel I was needing. 
After receiving it I noticed it is only intended to be used with "grand cameras" , like the EOS 1 series (film or digital) or to those other series cameras that already have a battery grip attached to them. Fortunately that's my case in which I always carry my 10D with its BG-ED3. I tell this since a 10D, 20D, DRebel or 350D body does not have a strap eyelet on its base. Only their compatible battery grip has it. 
So be aware that this nice, safe and comfortable accessory could not be attached to your prosumer camera if you don't have the corresponding BG.

I owned the Canon EOS 1-d, which I sold to obtain the &quot;latest-greatest&quot; EOS 1-d Mark II. My first model(1-d)came with this handstrap, and I found it to be VERY, VERY useful, and incrediby imporant me, being an action-sports photogropher-
 
 Imagine my dismay and anoyance at discovering that this item which was so useful and,(IMHO)absolutely necessary as my wonderful handstrap (WHICH WAS INCLUDED in the previous model)..... had been left out of the &quot;newer and so much improved&quot; version. 
 
 I've called and emailed Canon repeatedly(WHICH I STRONGLY SUGGEST ANY/EVERYONE DO)trying to bring attention to this issue, which, to me, is unexpected, and a completly unacceptable discrepancy. 
 Then consider the 30 plus dollars that Canon is TRYING to charge for it, and well here I go, off to my old fateful Amazon to GET ME ONE !! Actually, its from Adorama, and only about 20 bucks, instead.
 
 As for my review of the strap itself, if you haven't yet gathered; Considering the cameras weight, and me constantly running up and down dirt hills chasing motocross racers and the like, I found it literally, indespensible!
 Highly recomended !!

The clock itself works well. It did take till sometime during the middle of the night for the atomic time to connect (we set a backup alarm the first night). The idea of utilizing atomic time for an alarm is a fantastic idea, but why would Scott put such a lousy tuner in an atomic clock radio?  Doesn't make sense to me.  Granted, I live in a rural area, but I am able to receive both AM and FM stations from as far away as Fresno, some 50 miles away, on other radios in the house (including a small portable, battery-operated one), and we do have a local FM station.  The tuner is so sensitive that I had to use both hands to steady the dial when trying to tune in a station.  I am unable to receive one static-free AM station, and I eventually, very gingerly, dialed in two fairly clear FM stations (one Spanish-speaking from Fresno, one local), but neither stay tuned in overnight..by morning when the alarm goes off, nothing but static.  A strange thing though...once, while trying to locate a station, I received a fairly clear one from SALT LAKE CITY....wow!  I plan to return the product

The other reviews I am reading about this clock do not do it justice.  I just opened it 20 minutes ago, and it's on my desk already synched with the Atomic Clock.  I am very impressed.  The green LED is awesome!  I own a lot of atomic clocks, and this is the first LED one I've seen besides the ... Sangean/Proton one.  This thing is solid, and it looks like it was made in the 60's or 70's when you had heavy, quality electronics in a tight package.  This is worth way more than the selling price

I too bought these after not finding spindles of the Verbatim DL. A few work, but only a very few. I have an NEC recorder which works completely reliably on most media but not these. The machine is a dual Xeon with 2GB of RAM, so this is not a resource issue. Sigh

Memorex dvd blanks are my second choice and I bought two 50-count stacks of these because they had a great deal going on. In a perfect world, I would have gotten the same deal on 50-count stacks of Maxell dvd blanks. They are the best but you'll have a hard time finding a deal on them since everyone else knows they are the best.

But last night it suddenly stopped working and would not turn

Just one month out of warranty.

I purchased this unit about 18 months ago. After the warranty ran out, the unit first quit working with -R media. Then there is an issue with finalizing the DVD, which makes the dvd unusable. Unfortunately, this is after you record your show. Then all is lost. It started making squawking noises like something is very wrong. It never remembered the language or channels. Panasonic never did anything about this. After reading others with these same issues, I would recommend that you buy from another manufacturer

I bought this product after reading several reviews here at Amazon. The setup to configure it to my cable system was a little tricky, but once we got passed that, it worked like a charm. I have only lost one recording on one of my DVDs. It's strange how that happened, since the dvd wasn't in the player at the time. But that was almost a year ago and it hasn't happened since then. This recorder is intuitive and simple to operate. The conversion from video to DVD is flawless, and the finalization process is easy to understand as well. I especially like how you can adjust the recording time. Mine's currently set to about four hours. I am totally blind and needed a product that was easy for me to operate without sighted assistance. This definitely fills the bill! if you're looking for a great product at a reasonable price, buy this one! you won't be disappointed! I've converted almost 50 videos and recorded several TV shows with this recorder! great buy

I noticed there are several reviews on various products here, but this review is on the Panasonic DMR-ES10S (the S is for Silver).

I am not a technological wizard and impatient, so my husband set this up for me. I've had it about 5 months now and LOVE it. This is on the TV upstairs. I bought it because I was having trouble with our old RCA DVD recorder (unreliable), but that's another review.

Once setup it is complete, the unit is very easy to use. I read LOTS of reviews before buying and realized the cons that others had were not of concern to me, i.e. we don't have HDTV yet so 16:9 ratio not important. All I needed was something to record things from my TIVO unit and a DVR that could record on multiple DVD formats (DVD-R, +R, DVD RAM, etc.). 

Featues I Like:  I like the ample space the unit allows for actually typing in the name of the show (unlike the RCA which only let you have a few characters). I really use the Flexible Recording feature to exactly fit a movie or to fit lots of shows. I DID have to play around with this feature to figure out how to work it while recording multiple shows on one disk (manual wasn't useful with that part), but I use it all the time. The picture is really good, even with a 6 hour recording time, which I use for my decorating shows. The Change Thumbnail feature is also great. It allows you to select what picture displays when you browse through the programs. This is a wonderful feature that is important to me, esp with decorating shows, where I have the thumbnail be a feature of the room that I like. 

After reading some of the reviews here it seems my unit has A LOT of cool features which would be great for someone who is into electronics.  I am a basic girl, so I don't need a lot of bells and whistles. I just need it to do what I want without any hassles and without reading a 400-page manual. 

My only quibble is that some of the buttons on the remote are kind of small, even for my smaller female hands.

The RCA that I put on the TV downstairs is starting to mess up a lot now, so I will be purchasing a new unit. I've read reviews on the DMR-ES20, but since I am happy with this unit I am going to buy another one

I bought the iHome so that I could choose which songs to wake up to off of my iPod, and it worked well when it actually WORKED.  

After being very late to work three times because my alarm failed to go off I tossed the item - it wasn't worth all of the problems to keep at all if I couldn't even trust the alarm to get me out of bed in the morning.  

Other people have mentioned the too bright display and the "gradual volume increase", which I eventually got used to, but I could see how they would be incredibly annoying

A good add on to ipod compared to other costly or cheap products. The sound is good. It is loud enought to fill a medium hall with music. The wake-up and sleep funtions are good. The buttons are not smooth kind of make tik-tik noise. I wish we could forward and skip songs from the base. You can dimmer the back-Light if not needed. Recommend it

  Im probably one of few people on here who has a positive review for this item! I got this for christmas from my dad. I believe he bought it at best buy. Ive had it for almost ten months and I havent had any problems; it still plays the ipod, the clock still works, the date still works, and everything else still works. You dont even need to change the time; theres a switch on the back that lets you change it from standard time to daylight savings time. I dont know why people are complaining about that and the light; the light isnt THAT bright. If I encounter problems I will write another review but so far everything is perfect

I got this for Christmas last year.  I hardly use the thing and when I have I have been very careful in placing the ipod on and off of it. I can no longer play an ipod on it as there is no sound or too much static - apparently a short of some sort.  I was shocked as it had been used maybe 10 times by my wife and I.  Read all of the reviews I am not the only one who now has an overpriced doorstop.  Save your money and buy something else.

Take your time and read through the "cotton candy" 4-5* reviews which bump this up to an artificially high rating of 3* and you will see one consistent pattern, the connection to the ipod is very poor, the alarm doesn't function, and they feel it is overpriced

I searched and searched for the right mp3 player to use when I work out...and although this one had some bad reviews, so did all the others I looked at.  So I was a little scared, but went ahead and bought it...and I'm so happy!  It's so cute and sounds great!!!  Very glad that I choose this one

I've had my Sansa (the white one, with a pink silicone case... very cute) for about a month now and I couldn't be more pleased. I've had several players -- an Archos, an iaudio 'u2' -- and though both had their quirks, especially the Archos, ultimately the problem with both was the same -- their rechargeable internal (non-CHANGEable) batteries wore out and wouldn't hold a charge anymore. In contrast, the Sansa takes one AAA battery. Such a simple thing, but what a joy, I'll have the player long enough to see if it wears out normally from use! It comes with a battery, and I haven't had to change mine yet.

Radio reception seems rather good. It doesn't have line-in recording, as the iaudio did, but I didn't use that very much and haven't missed it. Has voice recording, which I haven't tried. Mounts right up on WinXP without any need for extra software. I've never wanted an ipod, because of the nightmarish software required to negotiate with them.

The Sansa's supplied ear buds sound very good, but are a trifle large (which is probably why they sound so good to me), noticeably larger than ipod ear buds; but are a little too large for my ears.

One more thing, I am pleased with the Sansa's interface -- there are enough buttons to comfortably handle all functions. The 'u2' had only a few buttons, a tiny display and no manual to speak of, and was a little frustrating to use. The Sansa is much clearer, has a very readable display, and very straightforward function selection and settings. Cleverness and simplicity is all well and good in a gadget, but take it from someone whose vision is not terribly good, if you can't see it, you can't use it. I'm glad I got this one

The software provided with the unit worked well, I bought another mp3 player from another manufacturer that locked up the computer.  The menus are easy to use, and it has a nice feature where you can pause the music and the Sansa MP3 player will automatically shut off if you don't hit the play button again.  My only complaint is the unit eats a lot of batteries- it is best to go with rechargables.  I get about 6 hrs playback time per battery.

I'd say the main strength of this player is it's easy to memorize, easily accessible buttons. By the end of the first day I was able to perform all of the player's features without taking it out of my pocket. That being said, the only complaint I have is that the equalizer isn't that effective, although this could also be a feature of the headphones too. They fit comfortably (the headphones) but the sound quality is only so-so. There's really not that much bass, but then what can you expect fron earbuds? Nevertheless, I'd definately recommend this player to anyone tempted to join the wonderful world of portable mp3 bliss.

I've been using NEATO and the 'MediaFace' software for years.  I LOVE the ability to calibrate the output so I can create 2 sided CD booklets that line up perfectly!  Sure you have to do a little test printing but that's what gives YOU the control.  This is definitely not for the Dumb and Dumber set.  If you want software and label materials that are 'designed with your mind in mind' and don't want creative control, then this is not for you.  I use it for CD booklets, CD labels, and jewel case inserts all on glossy paper and folks think the results are professionally done.  If you don't want to put in the effort, the get something else.  But if you like the freedom to express your creativity, this will give you the room you need

No where near as easy to use as my old system ,But with trial and error can have a decent amount of control over your Projects.But one interesting thing someone mentioned earlier
is that regardless of with system you use these labels can alter
the way DVDs play making them stick and freeze and wondering if its the disks,burner or what..after some experimenting I did
confirm that it was actually the labels I was having so much fun making...It might be the weight but i think its possibly the way the beam shines through the disc and reflects off the white label backing..Dunno but if you all of a sudden start having problems try a labeling tape or a sharpie

and I'm still happy! We initially had to get used to the software and the printer setup and yes, you do need some patience during the learning curve of this creative process - it's not the normal daily routine of most people.  We never encountered any errors when creating the actual labels or printing them.  We also have not had any problems upon using the labelled CDs or DVDs.  We're happy with the product

This usb hub is EXCELLENT!!  its small and compact, it actually communicates at usb 2.0 speeds, and the best part is that it doesn't need a separate power supply just to opperate.  This hub is designed to get all the power it needs from the usb port.  Overall this is the most well designed hub I've seen and with it having such a low price tag you can't go wrong

My Dell Laptop D600 running Windows XP, didn't recognize the device when I plugged it into either USB port.  I contacted Targus support and they stated that it should have worked and that I should try it on another PC.  If it doesn't work on this laptop, I have no use for it.  There is no CD ROM for support drivers and Targus support stated that I shouldn't need any drivers.  Went to Microsoft website for compatibility and the device wasn't listed.  I should have researched this before the purchase.  I would not recommend anyone purchasing it.

This little hub is just about everything you could want it to be. It's extremely compact, I don't think it's physically possible to have a smaller 4 port USB hub. At the same time it's also very solid and feels durable. The hub provides plenty of power and charges my ipod. A handy LED light turns on when the hub is plugged into your computer. I haven't done any formal benchmarks, but my ipod updates at the same song-a-second rate as it normally does when connected directly. I suppose that the hub does impose a certain bandwidth limit, so that you cannot have 4 devices transferring at the full USB 2.0 transfer rate at once, but that's to be expected. This would be excellent for any laptop user with a dearth of ports, or someone who just happens to need to connect a few more devices to their already maxed out system

I have purchased this DVD player to replace an older version of Sony DVD player that started to have problems playing DVDs (especially the scratched ones). Besides that I wanted to have a capability to play other formats (including photo discs, etc.). I think this was the right choice for the money. The DVD player handles every task as expected. Sony didn't disappoint

The device works perfectly.  The picture quality is excellent, the documentation is adequate, and the overall robustness of the machine seems good.  Loading is slower than my old DVD player - a Toshiba.  I really like the way I can watch one DVD part way through, replace it with another, and have the player still remember my place in the other one.  I also appreciate the HDMI interface but have not upgraded my television to take advantage of it yet.  In the end, I was willing to spend a few extra bucks for a quality player and based on performance so far, that's what I got

Using the HDMI output provides a HD quality picture.  I'm not sure if more expensive units have a better picture, but I doubt it.  Save your money and buy this unit instead of investing $1,000 in an HD unit that has only a few movies available in the new format

I have been thrilled with the quality of this player. I bought it for the HDMI connection (High Definition Multi Media Interface).  The player has performed with everything that I have thrown at it. The DTS is incredible and  I believe this unit is worth every penny.  Don't settle for a phony - buy a Sony

Recieved in 2 days, paid $116.99. Slim, lightwieght. Takes a little time to load but produces a really nice picture.  Hooked up to my Yamaha RX-V1600 reciever and then on to a Samsung LN-S4692D LCD HDTV, both via HDMI. Looks to be a quality DVD player with nice finish and again a really nice picture. Watched The Incredibles and Madagascar with the kids and everyone was really impressed. Would definitely recommend.

Also played DVD-R's on this player, no problems

I just ordered, but do not yet have my 1080p Sony Bravia XPR2 tv and my Dish Network HD package.  So what I am watching at the moment is a Sharp Aquos 26" 720p-ready tv.  I took the Sony dvd player out of the box, connected the HDMI connections to the player and to my tv, turned the player on and put in a digitally mastered retail dvd.  I didn't even have to open the operating instructions booklet.  The picture is so incredible that it makes it hard to watch regular tv with my non-hd tv Dish Network receiver.  I played a musical jpeg slideshow made with Memories on TV and burned onto a DVD+R.  Not only were the 6 megapixel pictures beautiful, but the HDMI connection gave me the full quality of the sound, even without a surround sound setup.  I then tried a movie slideshow made with an old version of Roxio.  The player actually improved the look of the little movies taken with an old Sony still/video camera.  These were very grainy as they were not really dvd quality.  They were over 100% improved when played through the dvd player.  Installation took about 2 minutes (because my tv HDMI connection is in an odd place).  I highly recommend this playe

I bought this for my computer, and it is useless.  The unit does not have enough power to provide back up power to my machine.  Be very careful when purchasing these.  I would first recommend contacting the manufacturer to see what they would recommend.  APC has offered to give me a discount on a new one if I use this as a trade in, but it would cost me a fortune to ship it.  Tiger Direct will (according to the website) only guarantee items against defect.  Therefore, I'm left with an expensive doorstop.  Don't make the same mistake, research before you buy!  My 19" monitor and Pentium 4 are too much for the 350VA

I'm not sure what happened with flagday1960's APC UPS, but I have had mine for over 2 years and it has performed flawlessly.   Whenever I've had an electrical power outage, the APC's software notifies me that it has reverted to battery power, and informs when commercial electrical power has been restored.  I can view the stats for my UPS - when and how long the last "event" (battery power activation) occurred, and the UPS current charge status.   My 350R has only 6 outlets - 3 battery/surge and 3 surge, the current 350 model provides 8 outlets - 4 of each.   While I can replace the internal battery of my 350R when it does die and is unrechargeable, I'll likely buy a new 350R in the near future, primarily for the extra 2 outlets

I have been trying to find a way to easily carry a lot of camera equipment for quite some time. I have tried backpacks, shoulder bags, duffel bags, but none of them really worked all that well. Then I saw the Lowepro Street and Field system with completely customizable pouches, vests, belts, and accessories. It works great, you only get the pouches you need so there is no waisted space and you can organize them however you want according to how often they are used (put frequently used items in easier to access places.) 

The variety alone of this system is worth the investment, but the quality and ease of use is also very high which is a big plus. You can get a case for any lens, camera body, or accessory you have. I even have cases for my cell phone and water bottle. One word of caution, be sure to measure your lens with the lens hood on backwards if you use them to make sure that the entire thing will fit into the pouch, because sometimes the lens will fit, but then the lens with the lens hood will not. I often carry 5-6 lenses, extension tubes, teleconverters, extra memory cards and batteries, and a bunch of cleaning supplies and other gadgets, which weights a ton. But when they are evenly distributed on this vest/belt Lowepro system it is actually very manageable. 

The only down side is that everyone will be staring at you because you have thousands of dollars of camera equipment strapped to your body. But if you can overlook that, this is the way to go. I have used this system at many zoos without ever having problems, in fact just unzipping a single lens and switching seems safer to me than opening an entire bag of equipment every time you want to switch lenses. Many of the cases also come with a built in rain/snow cover so if the weather changes all of your equipment is not destroyed. You can also put just a few pouches on a normal belt when you are just going to take photos in the back yard or don't need to take all of your equipment, which is nice. I really can't say enough about how much easier this makes traveling with a lot of equipment, if you have been hopelessly searching for a better solution, consider this, you won't regret it.

Bought this to free up my DVR - turn recorded movies into DVD's etc.  It works pretty well, accurate capture, easy to use.  Not crazy about the Software that's included.  Capwiz is OK, but limited, Ulead Video studio is clunky and sometime awkward to use, although between the two you can do just abou anything you need to.  It works BEST, if you record the HD version of shows.  Even if you don't have an HD TV, the converted image is much better

The hook up and downloading the software was very simple.  There was a error problem with the drivers.  My computer is fairly new with windows xp.  I called there support and was told to try it on another computer. I install it on my neighbors computer and the same happened. I sent it back to Amazon and credit my account, and bought an other brand.  Amazon is so great about handling returns.

I bought this to record Tivo DVR stuff to DVD.  Only mpeg capture device I have tried that gives a good quality picture.  Any other device I tried only worked converting to avi's, if at all.   Ulead's software is stable, and it's not a trial version.  If I use S-video instead of composite video, computer locks up (but that may be a problem on my end).  There are 2 different capture methods (Capwiz and Ulead's Video Studio).  Sound was a bit behind using Capwiz, use VS instead.  Would be nice to be able to set bitrate rather than be stuck with variable, but now I am just nitpicking

I have lots of analog video tapes from the 80's and onwards.  This device works very well in transferring them.  The video & audio are in perfect sync.

Pro: Very good device, very easy to use and install. You need a very powerful processor to work it right. Also, as I discovered and mentioned in the manual.  You must connect this device into the primary USB port. I have a hub where I first connected but the light was not coming on and the computer did not recognize the device. I opened the computer and made sure that it is connected directly into the USB attached to the motherboard and it worked very well.  The customer service is responsive but they will not work with you on your specific computer issues.

Cons: This device is processor intensive.  You MUST have the latest processor running at 3.XX Mhz or above and turn off all other ancillary programs while you are converting.  I encountered no problems when I followed the above guidelines.  The minimum requirments listed by the manufacture is probably absolute minimum.

It is a very good product and very easy to use.  I love it.

This product worked perfectly transferring to the computer and then using the included software to put several home movies on one DVD.  It also worked perfectly to transfer directly from VHSC tapes to DVD without transferring to computer.  Very simple set up and instructions.  The quality of the transferred videos was excellent!  You can also clip out parts of video seamlessly if you transfer to computer first very simply.  With the included software, you can do or add just about anything, music, frames, voice, etc.  No problems with the box getting hot or malfunctioning after over 4 hours of continuous use.

I tryed to use this on an older p4 1500 megahz and had a few glitiches during the recording (loss of frames).
Then I broke out the wifes new laptop and had no problem at all.
The S video from my old High 8 Video Cam came out perfect.  Sound was perfect too.
The point is you MUST have the power.  I do not care what the manufacture put on the box.
I would have given it 5 stars if the recomended computer requirements matched what I had to use to get the results.

I was very excited about this unit when I ordered it, but the pixelation was very bad due to the variable bit rate (VBR) encoding, and the DivX recording feature didn't actually work most of the time.  (A blank screen or a green screen was the result.)  Unfortunately, given these problems, I returned the unit.  I think I'm going to look at an older ADS unit without the VBR feature to ensure quality, and then do any DivX transfers by software.  It seems that the fewer variables involved may make for a higher quality image.  Too bad...this one really had a lot of potential

It took a lot of searching before I decided to purchase a good printer and this one is a great one. The pictures are clear and they print fast. I showed them to friends and didn't tell them that I printed them at home and they were very surprised when I told them. Spend the extra money and get a good printer. This printer also include photo ink, which is really needed for a clean print. Make sure you also get the right paper

... That said, I'm very happy with this printer. Other reviews, like the one on C|Net, have faulted the printer for mediocre text printing. I can't really address that complaint...have a laser printer for text and only use the S830 for printing photos and I'm very, very happy with how it performs that function. It's fast, I like being able to replace the ink cartridges separately, supports Exif if your digital camera outputs the encrypted data and the pictures are indistinguishable from those printed conventionally. It's the perfect color printer for my advanced amateur needs

We bought this printer to go with the canon G2 we bought.Excellent choice.First I must say if you are considering buying it from anyone other than Amazon[.com],DON'T.I have dealt with Amazon[.com] for years and they are the best at what they do,no one comes close.The printer is so easy to setup,not like some of are other printers.We are using Window XP,it went like a breeze.in lees than 30 minutes I was printing pictures.... I am still learning all the features,but the quality of the pictuers is as good if not better than any other.. And it is fast fast,printed 2 4x6 pictures in less than 4 minutes,I have found that you do need to buy quality paper.I used the Canon 4x6 bordless paper first until I ran out, then I switched to another brand,big mistake.Use the right paper and you to will be amazed

I have the digital camera Canon Powershot S200 and just purchased this printer. Set it up last night without any difficulty and the photos I printed were fantastic. I am very pleased with this purchase. Would highly recommend this printer. I did use generic photo paper to start out with and it worked just fine. I am hoping that in the long run this printer will pay for itself and cut the costs of having pics developed at the store

I bought this item, since I always make a lot of notes from books and other papers, and don't want to type it in manually anymore. This scanner, probably like any other model, needs a little training to get it right over the paper, but once done, it really works and faster than typing!
I dont use the addressbook or options with your GSM but they are no doubt very handy.
I just scan in from papers, and beam it to my laptop. Both Infrared and the cable work. The cable is especially great for using the scanner 'live'on the screen: the scanned text appears on the pc as you type!
The dictionary also comes in very handy.

It must be a very complex product, but just like the Ipod or ZenXtra mp3 players: they work!
So buy one and save some time! Excellent and recommended for anyone that needs to make notes, or studies, or just wants to stop cutting out pages in newspapers in a train e.g

I'm measuring, first and foremost, ease and precision of scanning. Speed of scanning and ease of installation on the computer are, in my mind, about the same for both the Wizcom QuickLink Elite and the C-Pen 800C. They differ sufficiently, however, in the primary question of ease and quality of scanning. For the record, I bought both at the same time, with the intent of keeping the better of the two. You can just go ahead and buy the C-Pen 800C.
I have had one horrible experience with a pen scanner by Siemens, the "Pocket Reader." It was truly useless. It scanned so poorly that I just put it aside. By the time I though to return it, Siemens was no longer making it, and I couldn't get customer service here in the U.S.
The Wizcom QuickLink Elite is not so bad. It's serviceable. I don't think it lives up to its 95% accuracy guarantee, but perhaps meets a 90% threshold, measured impressionistically. It's interface is also reasonable and satisfactory.
However, the C-Pen 800C is even more precise, truly approaching 95%. Moreover, if you discount errors in spacing from this accuracy percentage, its precision is even higher. Whereas the Wizcom is just as likely to make a content error, misread letters, etc., the 800C's errors are more likely to be the absence of a space when there should be one. A rare missed space doesn't make you puzzle over the text when you come back to it two months later.
C-Pen is also lighter, and it's rechargeable, so while it's more expensive, in the long run, you'll save on batteries.
Both have comparable single-language dictionaries, though Wizcom has more built in or for free (C-Pen allows you one free dictionary, including bilingual ones). Wizcom is a only a bit slower on the uptake, but significantly more likely to warn you "Scan too fast." I've never had that from C-Pen, and again, the precision at any speed is appreciably better with C-Pen.
Both have comparable PC and PDA compatibility capacity

As your DVD/CD collections grow, these are ideal for protecting and storing your "treasures". Easy to open and take up little storage space. The center lock tab is secure but allows you to remove the discs from the case with ease.

For slim jewel cases these are quite impressive. Their durability is outstanding and actually better than I expected. Usually I have been using slim cases primarily for data Cds. These are so convenient and durable I began using these for music CDs. I like them and continue to use them.

The majority of my cases were damaged in shipping. I immediately threw away about eight, but as I tried to use the rest I gradually found ten or so more that had sustained damage as well. Maybe I'm alone, given the other high ratings, but these seem more fragile than other slim cases I've used in the past. I'd give them 3-stars (because they're cheap) if they didn't have to be shipped.

I bought this stereo for my daughter's 9th birthday.  It's a great system with really good sound for the size.  It is easy use and is super thin and can hang on the wall.  It doesn't sit on a shelf easily; it tends to fall forward because it's heavier in front, so you should plan on hanging it

I have had this for about a year and it has worked well. I specifically bought it to tune into radio, so I have not used the CD player and whatever functions it might have. Pretty light, 7 of 10 sound quality, can hang on wall, detachable speakers. Good for cost. I would recommend and buy for a gift

I recently purchased this item for my wife who has a small office.  the reception on this unit is great.  Bieng in a steel building she is able to get all the local radio stations. The sound quality on it is perfect for a small room considering the price range it is in.  If you are looking for a booming sound this is not for you but it will provide a solid quality sound.

I bought this stereo for my baby's room. I needed something unobtrusive, with decent sound and that didn't break the bank. This fit the bell just perfectly.

And just in case you're wondering - this unit is almost EXACTLY the same as the $20 cheaper MCM235. The only difference is that the MCM240 can play MP3 CDs whereas the MCM235 cannot. Both, however, will play CD-R and CD-RWs.

The speakers can be mounted directly on the center unit and the whole system can be hung alone, or the speakers can be separated. However, when the speakers are separated, they cannot be hung on the wall themselves because there is no screw latch on the back of the speakers.
The speaker cords are long enough for most placements. If you decide to have the speakers mounted on the unit then you will pleased to know that there is a special place for the cords to be hidden behind the main unit. The only visible cord will be that of the electric plug.

It plays CDs and MP3 CDs (on CD-R or CDRW) well, and the sound was crisp and detailed.

The remote control is about the size of the iPod Nano (but a little wider). The buttons are rounded - but here's the first deficiency - the keys are NOT backlit. Until you can memorize the placement of the keys, you will not be able to use the remote in the dark.

There is a blueish backlit display on the center console. It displays the track being played, or the radio station in tune or, in standby mode, the time. Here's the second deficiency - the display can only be read when viewed head on. I mounted mine a bit too high on the wall, and I can't see what's displayed.

There is a timer feature and a sleep function.

All in all, this is a good system. But even with the caveat that you get what you pay for, the designers could've been a bit more thoughtful in the implementation

This thing is a joke. It doesn't play loud enough except for low volume listening. There is no handle to make moving it easy. Cheap, flimsy construction and a door that you know is going to break soon, no battery back-up for the memory. I would rather pay more and get something better. I am going to return it

I bought this stereo because of its relatively small size and stylish appearance and because it had aux inputs for me to hook up my mp3 player to it.  

The first unit I received would not turn on at all.  I contacted Philips' tech support, and their solution was for me to send the brand new defective stereo back to them at my expense.  Fortunately, Amazon has a very nice return policy, and I sent it back to them instead.  Amazon was also very nice in sending a replacement right away without waiting until they received the defective unit.

The replacement stereo arrived in short order, and I was immediately disappointed in the sound quality, which didn't seem as good as the 15 year old cassette player boombox that I was replacing.  After listening to the stereo for a few days and comparing it to a Sony CMT-NE3 bookshelf stereo that I own, here are my thoughts.

1. The FM reception is not as good as the CMT-NE3.  Both units have a thin wire type of antenna, and both wires are about the same length.  The Philips stereo, however, would hiss and crackle as I moved around the room - my body interfered with the reception.  This did not happen with the Sony stereo.

2. The sound quality is not as good as the CMT-NE3.  Playing the same song side-by-side on the two stereos, I found that the Philips stereo had a flat, tinny sound when compared to the CMT-NE3.  The Sony system had a much fuller and richer sound quality.  Also, there seemed to be significant distortion in the high-frequencies on the Philips stereo, making "S" sounds sound more like "H" sounds.  I also noticed an occasional crackle of distortion in the overall sound, possibly due to a bad connector on the aux input.

3. The ergonomics of the Philips stereo are not so good.  For one thing, the stereo will easily tip over forwards if accidentally bumped.  If that happens, the CD can get wedged in the CD tray and it becomes almost impossible to remove.  The electronically actuated CD door is much more likely to break than a passive mechanical door like the top-loading CMT-NE3.  The volume goes up to 31 or so, but 5 is about as loud as you would need it for regular listening.  This means that there are only 4 quieter volume levels, which is rather limiting.  Finally, the stereo is a bit bigger than I was expecting (though I could have looked more closely at the specs when buying it).

I am in the process of returning this stereo, and I will try to find a Sony system instead.  Unfortunately, Amazon no longer sells the CMT-NE3, which I bought just about a year ago.  I don't understand why electronics manufacturers feel the need to churn their product lines so rapidly.  Is there really that much innovation in bookshelf stereos?  The only difference between the Sony I bought last year and one I bought in 1989 is the ability to play MP3 CDs.

POSITIVES:
-Slick design and looks good mounted on the wall.
-Plays MP3 songs burned on a CD
-Good sound & loud enough (not for parties)
-It serves the purpose well
-Good deal for the money

NEGATIVES:
-Some old MP3 CDs skip. All the new MP3 CDs I burned worked perfect though.
-Clock turns off when the system is turned of

The tablet has been very helpful in my digital drawing classes and in my interior design business for quick sketching. It is user friendly, sturdily constructed and electronically dependable. I prefer the large screen format and this size is very adequate. If it should ever have to be replaced, I would purchase the same model. I highly recommend this particular tablet

Overall this product is worth the price.

Overview
To begin the footprint of this particular tablet is 17 5/16 X 13 1/4
so you have to have enough desk or table space to accomodate it.
The overall finish and quality of the tablet had some issues; mainly some rough casting of the clear plastic on the top. Ergonomically it feels at home placed on the lap with the dimensions making it quite stable.  The express keys feel solid though I don't use them as much as the quick keys.

Performance
Though I am a relative tablet novice I have taken to the Intuos 3 better than I have with my sibling's Intuos 1.  Pressure sensitivity can be adjusted to suit one's tastes making the tablet itself quite responsive.
the pen is light but solid.  I prefer the black felt tip stylus point rather than the standard plastic.  I have laid a sheet of vellum (thick tracing paper) over the tablet in order to simulate the sensation of drawing on paper (i prefer some resistance.)  The pen reacts the same as if the vellum weren't there.  The 9x12 image area allows me to use my shoulder for more fluid movements when I draw and does not feel cumbersome at all.  However i have not used the tablet mouse, it feels rather heavy and does not glide across the frosted plastic plate due to the layer of "felt" underneath the mouse. Installing the driver software is a snap and the customization menus are easy to understand.  NOTE: the option to switch from portrait to landscape (9x12--12x9) is available in case you're wondering which I was.

This tablet has made me more efficient and more productive.

Whether or not you are a 2D or 3D artist, this tablet makes it all the more enjoyable. I had an Aiptek 12000U which died no less than 3 weeks from purchase date. This Wacom is so much better.

I love the customisation of it. Its fantastic! Only one gripe with it, and it may be just me, but I would love it if you were able to customise the touch strip and buttons to each program - just as you can with the stylus.

Throw your mouse away - this one's a keeper

I have been in the computer industry for well over 20 years and I have used just about every graphics tablet there is over that period.  I recently had a need to get a new one for my own personal use and I got this Intuos3 9x12 and it is one nice piece of equipment.

No Batteries, no power cords just a short USB cable to the computer.  And it truly is an aesthetically beautiful piece of work.

I have no complaints what so ever; My Mouse works perfectly I am even using it to play Links2003 (Golf).  Don't expect to drop strokes right off the bat, it will take a round or two to get used to the "swing" just like any new "Club" would.  However I would not consider using it for any fast action games; only smooth steady strokes, billiards, golf, etc

In short, everything I expected and more.  I love this Table

Best Tablet ever - get it if you like wide strokes

this one is top expesive one

<review_text>
Best ever, I can tell...

My choice for a 9X12 format was a decision taken based on my traditional arts background, since I make oil paintings and traditional lineart drawing for concept arts, I use very much wide strokes by a combination with "wrist and arm wide motion".
So this tablet is well suited for this task not too much exagerated on size and not too small for the wide movements.
A 6x8 Wacom Tablet would be more restricted to me, but for those who like small area usage for drawing and painting this 9x12 has a digital adjust so you can work with it as a 6x8, but remember to have space on your desk, it's not a 'mouse pad' definitively, get a 19" monitor screen - flat it down on the table, that's almost the same space you gonna need.
By the way... for those thinking on something different from WACOM tablets... don't think! WACOM is the only one you can trust 100%, no doubts, I've tried many...
If you don't know wich wacom suits best for you, I suggest you go to www.wacom.com, they have a questionaire there to help you out, but it is simple: if you are a pro... get this Intuos3 or better Intuos available, that's the hardcore professional choice, if don't need much pressure sensitivity, and make 'lighter' work, go to the Graphire, and if you are a pro and want something to work with milimetrical accuracy like architecture or technical design get a Cintiq (this one is top expesive one).

Other application will work perfect with it too, like 3D software, I use XSI, Max, Maya, Zbrush(this one only with a WACOM please!), Modo and many other applications for composing and editing like Combustion and Premiere, it changes the way you work for a better productivity, believe-me.

Pen tilt is great with "Painter" software, what you maybe would take a day to finish you do in seconds literally, with a wrist sweep and tilting the pen you can create amazing effects in one second.

Also will reduce the stress on your hand and arm caused by the mouse, it will improve your life quality by not harming you like a mouse does when you get to many our on computer. Besides it has programmable buttons on it and a smart scroll, so you may use you mouse only for games after that.

Another important point - the USB cable is huge enough so you can work confortably away from your monitor screen with the tablet on your lap if wish so.

To finish: I love my 9x12 Wacom, if you buy it you will love it too, and give it the accessories so this babe will get happier *lol*
A travel bag, replacement tips (nibs) kit, and for sure if you can or need... buy other pen like the 6D art pen and the airbrush so you will make extraordinary artworks.

Hope this helps on your choice. Best regards!

I have to say that after years and years of greedily drooling at the thought of getting a 9x12 Intuos tablet, I have finally purchased the 9x12 Intuos 3. And it's huge. Not HUGE like thick or heavy, just spacious.  And so far I can't put it down.  Really.  I haven't cleared enough space on the desk.  But then why would I want to?  It doesn't get hot, it's the right size for a lap desk, and I can use it for most of what I do from 9 to 5. Except typing. Anyway here's my take on it:

-----------------------

SIZE

I'm moving up from the 4x5 Intuos 2 which will now live in my laptop bag.  You may be just fine with a smaller tablet, and travel concerns may make this a little unwieldy.  The full tablet is 3 additional inches on the left right and bottom sides around the 9x12" area, so it's a grand total of 17x13" in the bag.  No big deal for anyone accustomed to carrying an art portfolio around.  Stack two Intuos2/Graphire 4x5 tablets flat on top of each other, and that's about how thick it is.  (If you're considering buying a 9x12 you probably have a few of these lying around)

TABLET & SCREEN AREA

if you don't like the overabundance of space, you can always limit the tablet area in the Wacom control panel to ANY dimensions up to 9x12, mapped to any area of the pad.  I feel sometimes that I am moving my arm way too far all over this space for most of my work, so it's good to know I can reduce the physical tablet area controlling the entire screen to a 3x5 box in the corner.  This particular feature is very good for "tracing" a photo or small object placed on the tablet and still drawing to the entire screen.

Likewise you can limit the amount of screen area the whole tablet can control.  For VERY VERY precise control over a small screen area this is the best option.  An alternative to zooming the image to work details.  Also useful for avoiding accidental menu-clicks, and prevents the pointer from migrating into toolboxes or clicking scrollbars and other windows.

All this space does provide a fantastic level of control.  It's just different.  You realize how little you move the mouse most of the time to work on a computer when you start using your entire arm to work.  Usually it's all about the flick of the wrist.

QUICKPOINT "VIRTUAL-TABLETS"

An added bonus I discovered (not on the smaller tablets to my knowledge) is the "Quickpoint" dual tablet feature. Two "virtual" tablets control the same screen.  The lower left or right corner becomes a tiny 2x3 tablet, and the upper left/right opposite corner becomes a 7x9 tablet (approximately).  The 2x3 gives you fast access to the whole screen with very little pointer movement, and the 7x9 gives you precision control.  Two tablets in one!

WIDESCREEN / DUAL MONITOR SUPPORT

Happy to say it works very well with dual screens.  You can span both screens using the full tablet, choose which screen to control exclusively, or reduce the functional tablet area to match the aspect ratio of spanned/dual monitors.  

As far as widescreen monitor support, this tablet can automatically adjust the active area to match the aspect ratio of any screen.  So if you are considering the 6x11 widescreen Wacom, remember this tablet can double as a 7x12 widescreen.  I used a grey Sharpie to draw faint lines on the tablet surface to map out different screen ratios.

BASICS

USB of course.. Nice 8 foot cord so you can move around a bit, excellent for putting the tablet in your lap.  Has a pretty blue light.

Thankfully the 1/2 "tracing overlay" is gone. Sorry to whoever was saying that was the primary feature for them.. In my experience it just gets dirt and coffee and whatever else you carelessly do to your tablet all stuck up in it. And if you accidentally crease it.. oh the pain... 

STYLUS & NIBS

The grip pen is nice, bigger than the Intuos 2 pen and has a good weight, otherwise the same. The "6D" art pen actually has two tips inside the felt nib, but sometimes the tablet doesn't register both tips (critical to rotation data) unless you plunk the nib down FLAT on the tablet before you start your stroke.  Without both tips active it just works like the grip pen.

The nibs are interesting, I haven't discovered how the springloaded "Stroke Nib" is so much different from the standard white plastic nib.  Says it's "amazing" on the website but really.. ehh.  But the "Felt Nib" is definitely different.  Kind of makes me think of a Flair Pen.  It has considerable friction against the surface and squeaks on the tablet like a marker. This is good if your hand isn't surgeon-steady or if you want slower more precise strokes, but it is a bit grabby if you press too hard. Draw lines with a Sharpie marker on copier paper with a little extra pressure and it feels about the same.  My previous trick with the Intuos 2 was to tape paper on top of the tablet to add friction. 

MOUSE 

As for the 5D mouse, I think it's easier to use a regular mouse on the side.  Although the extra surface area makes a mouse much more practical on this pad than it is on a 4x5.  

The mouse will jitter and is act strange IF you don't put the tablet in "mouse mode."  The software *should* just do that automatically, but sometimes it doesn't catch on.  Once the mouse is specifically set to mouse mode in the driver settings it should stay in mouse mode any time it's on the pad, and can be moved relative to wherever screen pointer is just like a regular mouse. Otherwise in pen mode the mouse directly tracks the tablet precisely where you place it, and the screen pointer jumps to that spot--just like the pens.  If you WANT you can put the pens in mouse mode, but again, weird.

MACROS

I use the Wacom mice mostly to run unrestricted macros that Microsoft and Logitech don't seem to want to let you run with their "programmable" mice these days.  Think "QuicKeys" on a mouse. You can program an unlimited string of keystrokes and menu commands, and link the macros globally or restrict them to specific applications.

THE "EXPRESS KEYS"
(THOSE RECTANGLE THINGS ON THE SIDES)

You can program the left and right sets independently.  Again, you have complete control of any method of macro you'd like to assign to any of the buttons.  There is a whole list of options for each button and both scroll bars.  So you have eight buttons and two scrolls to program to your heart's desire on the pad.  IN ADDITION to simple button macros there is a "pop up menu" you can assign to any of the buttons.  Just like a Windows Right-Click menu, it appears wherever the pointer is--only you have complete control of the menu content.

CONCLUSION

My only gripe goes to Adobe for disabling most of the stylus/pen features in Photoshop by default. It gets a little tiresome enabling size, opacity, tilt, and rotation for almost every brush.. 

As for everything else the tablet was meant to do different from a mouse, pressure sensitivity, tilt, rotation, high resolution tracking, lack of jitter.. it works fantastically. I'm just going to have to adjust to the huge 9x12 stroke. So give your Aiptek to someone you hate this Christmas, and hook yourself up with a Wacom! 

Next up, Cintiq!  Paycheck.. well, better job, paycheck, THEN Cintiq!

---------------------------

WISH LIST

Why do we have only one pointer (focus point) on the screen?  Why not a dedicated pointer per-device now that USB makes the mouse addressable?

A "Wacom Glove" would be great.  If I could put on a special glove or just little thimble-nibs and have fingertip control on this tablet they'd have one helluva product.  Kids could fingerpaint!

In addition to that, is there any technical reason why given the right input device this thing couldn't function like one giant "touchpad" with surface area detection and everything?  If the 6D can recognize two points simultaneously, what's the technical limit?

bye

This is an awesome tablet! It has great pressure sensitivity and the pen allows for fantastic freehand drawing in programs like illustrator, photoshop and painter. The pen is a more natural feeling tool to use in these applications than a mouse. The size of the tablet allows you to get into greater detail without having to zoom in all the time.

I've been using the 9x12 for a few months now and I have been very happy with the product's improvements over the Intuous 2 line. I love the fact that it is only about an inch thick and fits easily into my lap--the Intuos 2 was monstrous by comparison. The only reason I give it four stars instead of five is because the mouse, which should be among the most accurate mice available, suffers  from awful jitter. I am not even touching the mouse and it is jittering up and down about a pixel or two. 

Still a very good pen tablet, but the mouse part needs work

I'm a digital media student and freelance multimedia artist, and my mom is a retired commercial artist.
We both bought the tablet after putting up with the Aiptek version for a year.

Cons: The included mouse doesn't have many of the movement control features of a regular mouse. I'd recommend using a normal optical mouse along with the tablet. Besides, you're not buying this for its mouse.

Pros: Loads of included software (that you'll actually use), perfect compatibility with Adobe Photoshop's features (a huge discount for Adobe Photoshop CS is included), surface is washable and scratch resistant, no batteries required, awesome sensitivity at any pressure or angle, two pens in one (top of pen works as eraser tool in Photoshop) and above all, it's the industry standard choice. All other reviews will agree. There's no better tablet, and I stand by that. I've used it with everything from Adobe Photoshop CS2 to Adobe Illustrator CS2 to Macromedia Flash MX to Alias Maya.

Rated as 3000 hour bulb life when purchased, today they claim 4000 hours.
Bulb lasted only 900 hours.  Service at "unfocused" does not care about creating a satisfied customer base.  Would not replace bulb even on a prorated basis

 I have to rate this product and this company as horrible!!

I purchased the X2 in 12/2004. Everything was fine. In 6/2005, the lamp blew. Less than 300 hours on it!!! I called the company. They said sometimes it happens. I questioned the projector. They said I just needed a new lamp. $300.00 later.....oh, you can only get the lamps from them. You can only get service on the X2 from them.

I get the new lamp. It just blew again-about 700 hours-half of what the life should be. Additionally, the fan died-which may be why the lamp blew. Maybe there was a problem with the fan a year ago (when it was STILL under warranty but they wouldn't look at it!!!) No. They say no.

The projector was ceiling mounted and never moved since it was first put in place. The projector was blown clean on a regular basis. This projector was not mistreated or misused.

Infocus says "sometimes this happens".

They, for $250, plus $30.00 shipping, will fix the fan. I also need to buy a new lamp-another $300. The company keeps saying-"It is out of warranty", "sometimes this happens", "1400 hours is just what some lamps get", etc., etc,. etc.. They will not accept that perhaps this was a defective product.

I will get a new projector-I can buy a new one for what they want to charge to maybe fix my current one. My new projector WILL NOT/WILL NEVER be an Infocus product.

They have failed to stand behind their product. Their service is overpriced and their technical support and customer service is nothing more than drones citing manuals and warranties.

Don't buy Infocus!!!

I purchased this multimedia projector on behalf of a local non-profit organization after comparing its specifications with other projectors with similar prices. Several comparable projectors are available currently, and I chose this one because of good experience with its previous model (the X1) and slightly better specs. 

Our initial experiences with this unit have been completely satisfactory. The controls are easy to use, the output is bright and sharp for an audience of around 40 people. I was disappointed, however, to discover that it has only one adjustable leg toward the front of the projector. That leg is used in tilting the projected image upward, but  we had to use found materials to level the unit. Two legs would be better!

Good product, forget about service. I e-mailed InFocus about my faulty projector 8th January 2005
it is now 7th January 2006 and I still do not have my projector. That's right, it's been ONE YEAR since
my projector stopped working, I have given up on it being repaired (it was under warranty) and am now
struggling to get it back so that I can repair it out of my own pocket. Check this company's record at 
the Better Business Bureau, it is deemed to be unsatisfactory due to unanswered complaints

EXCELLENT IMAGE FOR LITTLE MONEY!

I bought the Infocus X2 to replace a worn out and broken $15,000.00 "high end" CRT projector. My budget would not allow for a more appropriate replacement. While the X2 could never satisfy the true videophile, who usually spend anywhere from $10,000 to $30,000 dollars on a projector, it was never intended to.  

That being said, I will say that the Infocus X2 when being shown on my Stewart 100" screen is projecting an impressive image that is pretty close to the $15,000 unit it replaced!  A true videophile will certainly see the difference, but your average person will not. With my limited budget, I am quite satisfied with the very good image quality.  DVDs are sharp and clear, TV is quite satisfactory also. 

If you are looking to enter the big screen front projector market, and you don't want to spend more than a thousand dollars, here you go! 

But seriously folks, even though it works, stop shining your projector on a wall....  get yourselves a screen. There are special reflective properties in a screen that a painted wall doesn't have to really bring your image to life.

Bottom line - best major purchase I have made since I bought a home with a finished basement!

I got the projector and mounted it on the ceiling in my basement projecting on a light-brown wall. I expected that I would need to paint the walls white, or get a screen, but was shocked by the amazing picture quality. Here are the details:

1) Comcast Cable with HiDef Box. Hidef program is so amazing it makes me want to cry. Sports programing blows the mind away. I even enjoy watching boring hi-def shows with the wife, like the Oscars, just because I am so amazed at how crystal clear the picture looks. You feel like you are there! Regular TV looks surprisingly great too, but setting it up right is critical. Make sure to change the aspect ratio back to Native (vs 16:9 when watching hi-def channels).  Ensure that the HDTV cable box has the following settings:  
Aspect Ratio (controls regular programming) = 4:3 letterbox
Output Type (controls High def programming) = experiment with 720P vs 1080i
4:3 overide (controls regular programming)= 480p.
I am also using the expensive $99 monster DVI cable to connect to the cable box. This is essential to make regular TV look great vs grainy.  Get the DVI to M1 connections, wires and adaptors - you MUST budget this into your overall budget or the projecter will not be a great buy (see my "problem" section below).

2) X-Box. I purchased the Hi-Def cable/wire from Microsoft for $20. Once you buy the cables, you can go into the Xbox dashboard settings to allow for 720p and 1080i. Most games are in 480p and 16:9 format. The few Games in highdef look fantastic!  You can check hdtvarcade.com to see the exact resolution of every game.

3) DVD player: Since the Xbox only outputs in 480i, I wanted to try the upconversion DVD players. I first tried the Denon 1910. That did NOT work when using a DVI cable!!! It might have been because it was refurbished or possibly it was because the Infocus X2 is not HDCP compliant?? I'm not sure, but the 1910 warns against non-HDCP compliant units and InFocus says that x2 is non-compliant - so that's my best guess. Next I tried the TOSHIBA SD-5970. That worked, and I hooked it up using the $99 Monster HDMI to DVI cable. I'm not sure if it was worth it, because DVD's look great, but NOT Amazing compared to HiDef Comcast programming. The verdict is still out, but I have never seen any of the DVD's like Finding Nemo that supposedly look MUCH better with progressive scan DVD's. I can't tell much difference between when DVD is set to 720p vs 1080i HDMI output.

Once again, everybody that comes over, including the sceptic wife, is shocked by our basement - they all say its like a full-scale theater, much bigger and clearer than a regular big screen TV and I don't even have surround sound yet - that'll be my next big purchase. Infocus X2 is highly recommended, but be sure to check out the problem section below: 
  
Problems 
1) My InFocus X2 does not have any component inputs. That means to get premium quality, you must come through the M1/DVI input. If you have a DVD, Cable box and Xbox like me, it is a real pain to switch the cable in the back (especially with a ceiling mount). I got myself a step ladder to make it easier. The DVI switcher for 4 DVI cables is TOO expensive, almost $400.

2) Be prepared to spend at least $3-400 after you get your InFocus to purchase DVI cables for the cable box, possibly HDMI cables if you buy a progressive scan DVD player, as well as adapters to connect your DVI cable to the M1 computer port... Its definitely worth it, but just be prepared.  In my opinion, the progressive DVD player is optional (saves you approx $150), but the cables are mandatory.

3) No way to turn off unit with remote (and yes it is still a little noisy in whisper mode, but once the movie starts you can't hear it anymore). I have it set-up so that after it cools/powers down I just turn off the entire unit on the wall switch since it is ceiling mounted.

The de-interlacer chip is unneaded as long as you use all progressive sources.

In fact when you input HDTV it uses the same scaler as the X1 and H30 projectors.

The image quality is great.  Just dont try and watch TV on it, you'll claw your eyes out.

I can't push that enough, the projector is awesome, as long as you use NO interlaced sources

I love these cases.  The colors are nice, the see-through feature is helpful, they keep my DVDs and CDs clean and are great for mailing, also.  Not one of mine has ever broken, but you DO need to open them correctly so as not to destroy them (I can't imagine any other way one would break unless you stepped on it, bent one severely, or beat one to death.)  They are made of the same type of plastic in which commercial CDs are packaged.  I always prefer to buy this exact type and brand of case

But I love these cases.  I have had no problems with them yet.  They snap closed, stay closed and are fairly sturdy.  Granted, I do not go throwing them around or anything.  But for organizing things and keeping the dust off, these cases do a good enough job for me

Sure, these colorful jewel cases are pretty to look at but I give their functionality an F. As soon as I opened one of these cases to put a CD in it, the case broke. It happened to 3 cases out of the 12 I have used already. I wasn't using excessive force, in fact most people call me gentle. Buy at your own risk and HANDLE WITH CARE!

I was hoping for a great deal on these batteries, but like other reviewers I've found that they run out of juice incredibly fast.  I'm amazed that other reviewers have had such good luck because things like my wireless keyboard which uses two AA's ran out of juice in a couple days of normal use while my automatic sprinkler time that uses two AA's lasted only a week.

Be warned that these aren't quite the bargain they may initially seem

I have used about half of these batterys. Mostly in clocks and different items around the house, but also I used them in the flash for my camera and they held up real good. 

I have a lot of rechargeable batterys, but these are better because they last a lot longer. Often the rechargeable batterys only last for a few months if that long. Alkaline batteries for me can last for up to a year and longer. 

If Amazon went back to free shipping on these then I would buy them up and give them to friends as a gift or a prize. I do not know what the shipping is, but it may still be worthwhile. I just know so far these batteries have held up real good and I would highly recommend them.

Excellent value -- these batteries are just as good as name brands for about half the price.  If you use a lot of AA's, this is the way to go -- made especially nice if you use them as a filler to get your shipping free on your entire order if it is hovering in the $18 range

I bought the BE650R for two purposes:  The first is to provide battery backup power for my home computer system on a daily basis.  The second is to use with my portable generator to provide "clean power" to all of my electronics when the power goes out and I'm forced to use it.  The BE650R handles both situations very well.

The provided PowerChute software installed without a problem and managed the computer system perfectly when the power went out, completing a graceful shutdown when the battery got low.  APC only provides the most basic version of their software (you have the option of buying an upgraded one).  It doesn't have any reporting or testing features, but given the size of the BE650R I don't see why you would care.  This is a UPS for workstations and small electronic, not servers, so I don't see the need for robust UPS software. 

The UPS hooks up via a provided USB cable and the setup was very easy.  The BE650R provide about 11 minutes of run time for my system, which is comprised of a 350-watt computer, 19-in lcd monitor, wireless router and dsl modem.

As for using the UPS with the generator, I haven't had any problems so far.  The generator maufacturer recommmends using at least a surge supressor with their product, but I figured a UPS would be one step better.

I would definitely recommend this unit

I own 3 compact flash cards by viking and bought them in this order, 128Mb, 256Mb, and recently 2Gb. I have never had any problems with any of these cards and have always looked for Viking Compact Flash cards whenever I needed any.

This 2Gb card works perfectly with my Ipaq pocket pc storing a variety of files from mp3 to mpeg (video) to word, excel, and maps for my pocket pc gps system.

I did try a Lexar card once and found it did not work with my pocket pc as well as this one as not all the files on it were recognised.

I will always buy Viking compact flash

I've owned various Viking branded memory cards in the past and have always been pleased with their performance, until I purchased this 2 GB CompactFlash card.  

It's possible that this card works well in other uses, but I found its performance unacceptable as storage for RAW images shot with my Canon Digital Rebel SLR.  Anywhere from 1/5 to 1/10 of the images were corrupted, particularly bad in continuous shooting mode.  Contrast with my Lexar Media 512 MB and 1 GB cards, which were able to shoot reliably with no corrupt images under the same conditions, and without as much of a lag time as the Viking card (often left waiting 15+ seconds after shooting as few as 3 continuous images while the card to "recovers")

I've used Viking CompactFlash cards in digital cameras for years and have *NEVER* had a problem with *ANY* of them.  Never a glitch; every bit has always come through perfectly (and I did have a glitch with a CF card of leading brand "S...").  I do not own this particular Viking card, but I've owned 64MB, 128MB, 256MB, 512MB, and 1GB Viking CF cards and used them in 3 different (Canon) cameras.  As far as I know, this 2GB CF cards uses the same technology as at least the 1GB card I use all the time.

All that said, standard Viking CF cards are "8x" write speed (about 1.2MB/s write speed).  That is slower than many other CF cards. That may be an issue for point-and-shoot digicams with limited image buffers, but I've never found that to be a problem in digital SLRs with large write buffers -- the camera continues to shoot more photos while the Viking card finishes writing to the CF card.  For the price, the Vikings have been "winners" in my book.

A previous reviewer commented about difficulties with Viking Customer Service -- I have to wonder what the problem was that he experienced with the *product* that let him to call Viking's Customer Service in the first place?  Was it anything serious, or did he just have a question?  He never said.
(Not that the Cust Svc comments he quoted are excusable, if true; but they're so outrageous that they're a little hard to believe)

Works OK. The batteries do get hot by the end of the charging period and it takes about 15 min to let them cool down by themselves. I don't know how long they would last if charged so quick but so far they look fine and the price of similar batteries is cheap. This is not an extremely "smart" charger (special wave cycle, etc.) but it works

THIS CHARGER IS EASY TO USE AND YOU KNOW WHEN THE CHARGE IS FULL AND COMPLETE. IT ALSO CHARGES THREE AAA AS WELL AS DOUBLE AA. YOU CAN ALSO USE THE TWO CENTER CHARGING TERMINALS TO CHARGE TWO 3 AAA OR TWO DOUBLE AA BATTERIES.
THE PRICE IS ALSO GOOD AS WELL AS THE SHIPPING CHARGE.
THE FOUR 2400 BATTERIES SEEM TO LAST MUCH LONGER THAN THE 2000 BATTERIES.

I returned this contract and asked for a refund but NEW ignored my first two emails. Then I called them and they informed me of their shady business practice that it would take 8 weeks to refund my account. I then contacted Amazon and they resolved the matter in one day. I read reviews for NEW and most people that actually had to deal with NEW were not happy. The 77% positive rating they have is misleading because the majority of people rating them have never actually had to use the product.

Mouse does not glide smoothly on some surfaces due to the large depression on the bottom of the mouse designed to hold antenna.Mine would not glide smooth on rubber mousepad or plastic nor my corrian counter top. The idea is good however because when you insert the antenna the mouse turns off. This being said it may deserve 5 stars if the correct surface is used

Upon buying my notebook computer, I immediately purchased this mouse.  The touch pad on the laptop is sufficient for basic navigation, but for heavy use, especially web browsing, an external mouse is a must.  The mouse has an USB adapter that clips on the bottom of the mouse for convenient storage when not in use.  Mouse works fine even several feet away from laptop. The curved buttons that fit your fingers make using this mouse very comfortable to use for long periods of time.  I highly recommend this devise for greater laptop productivity & enjoyment.

a great mouse! perfect size, nice features. Simply plug it in and it starts working! Seems to be well made. To install the battery you have to push in the silver logo button on the back end of the mouse really hard. Then the casing top pops off.

however, for some reason, at least on my hp laptop- when this is plugged in the screensaver will not come on if left there. I need to unplug it if I'm gonna be gone for awhile.

I love this winter blue color, I'm so glad that I chose it. I have only had this for a couple months, but it works fantastically. I just hope it lasts as long for me as some of the other reviewers have said it lasted for them

My roommate's mouse broke (she had the older L shaped receiver)... and I thought it was because she's bad with technology. But I'm a computer junkie who knows how to take care of her technical equipment... and even mine broke (a few months later, I had a straight receiver). It just gave up on me. Not a battery issue. More like a connection issue.

Now I read all these reviews about it breaking on people. Well, I'll write back when my other roommate's break, and when my cousin's break.

Don't get me wrong... but it was great while it lasted. Less than half a year. Gonna go back to my Logitech. That never broke on me

I have had my mouse for about 8 months and it is broken. The "L" shaped design for the thing you hook to the computer is the problem. I will call it a receiver. It you stow the receiver too many times into the mouse it starts to break. Over time the receiver doesn't receive. 
I would not recommend this product. It's better to have a straight receiver.

Beware of this product.  It always freezes up half way though the download when transfering photos to my computer.  I have another USB 1.0 card reader that works perfectly.  I upgrade to get the speed boost with USB 2.0, but this product is fundamentally flawed and buggy

The convergence of electronics.  Instead of spending in a Memory Card and a USB Memory separetly, you can use them both (saving some money and space).  You also improve the video and picture downloading to any computer or Xbox without cables of software installation

I use this to read the Trans-Flash card from my mobile phone (with SD card adapter).  It works as expected, but seems to have higher throughput to/from the flash card than my desktop 12-in-1 card reader.  I bought it on someone else's recommendation to begin with.  Very satisfied

I bought this memory card for my Canon SD 200...after using it for approximately 3 months with no problems whatsoever, I took a video and the card just flat out broke.  First the screen said "Image not available" and then "memory card error".  I tried everything to fix it - but nothing worked.  I lost all the pictured I had stored on it, and found it was cheaper and easier to just buy a new memory card instead of paying to get it fixed...now I have a Panosonic one and I'm really happy with it.  My advice: splurge on the more expensive card from a reliable brand, and it'll be worth it

Bought this charger through Amazon when we lost the charger that came with our Canon Digital Rebel XT. This seemed like a good option at a good price and it has proven to be so. I actually prefer this to the Canon charger, which always felt like more of a travel charger to me. This one can sit on my desk and I don't have to get down on floor to get the battery. It also includes a car adapter and foreign power adapter - nice extras. To me this is the right charger to have around the house, even if you have the Canon charger (bring that one on your vacations since it packs up nice and small with the caveat that it's easy to forget in a hotel or something). Get an extra battery when you get this charger too so you can always have a charged up battery ready to go

I have been trying to find a way to easily carry a lot of camera equipment for quite some time. I have tried backpacks, shoulder bags, duffel bags, but none of them really worked all that well. Then I saw the Lowepro Street and Field system with completely customizable pouches, vests, belts, and accessories. It works great, you only get the pouches you need so there is no waisted space and you can organize them however you want according to how often they are used (put frequently used items in easier to access places.) 

The variety alone of this system is worth the investment, but the quality and ease of use is also very high which is a big plus. You can get a case for any lens, camera body, or accessory you have. I even have cases for my cell phone and water bottle. One word of caution, be sure to measure your lens with the lens hood on backwards if you use them to make sure that the entire thing will fit into the pouch, because sometimes the lens will fit, but then the lens with the lens hood will not. I often carry 5-6 lenses, extension tubes, teleconverters, extra memory cards and batteries, and a bunch of cleaning supplies and other gadgets, which weights a ton. But when they are evenly distributed on this vest/belt Lowepro system it is actually very manageable. 

The only down side is that everyone will be staring at you because you have thousands of dollars of camera equipment strapped to your body. But if you can overlook that, this is the way to go. I have used this system at many zoos without ever having problems, in fact just unzipping a single lens and switching seems safer to me than opening an entire bag of equipment every time you want to switch lenses. Many of the cases also come with a built in rain/snow cover so if the weather changes all of your equipment is not destroyed. You can also put just a few pouches on a normal belt when you are just going to take photos in the back yard or don't need to take all of your equipment, which is nice. I really can't say enough about how much easier this makes traveling with a lot of equipment, if you have been hopelessly searching for a better solution, consider this, you won't regret it.

Lowepro offers consistently well-made products, and this SlipLock Pouch is no exception.  It is secure and well padded. I use it to hold a Garmin GPS60CS GPS receiver, but you could easily use it for a small digital camera or other accessory.  It is a bit deep for the smallest cameras, which might tend to get lost in the bottom of the pouch, although you could put additional items like spare batteries underneath to raise them up.  The main pouch has a double-closure design for good security: a drawstring closure is covered by the main flap with a velcro seal.  A front mesh pocket is a good place to store small things like spare AA batteries or, in my case, an external antenna for the GPS.  A cleverly designed double-velcro sealed belt loop allows you to easily and securely attach the pouch to your belt or the hip-belt of a backpack without having to remove your belt. Two D-rings on the sides also give you the options of using it with a shoulder strap.

NOTE (5/3/06): The photo of this pouch has recently been changed and no longer looks like the pouch I reviewed.  I don't know whether it is an error in the photo or whether Amazon has used the same description for a completely unrelated product.

NOTE  (5/27/06):  Correct photo has been added again

First of all, these are good speakers, nice design but it has one flaw.

batteries...
A. it eats them up ...FAST
B. if you use batteries instead of the wall plug in it comes with, it wont go as loud, and if it thinks your playing it to loud, it will start..skipping.. or something of the sort.

But, it has good sound quality, and honeslty when your on the go, when do you really need it blasting?

Also they are just..barley large enough that you cant put them in large jean pockets sadly, but it doesnt weigh much at all. 
And i really like how if i ever say..lost my Ipod somehow, it has a Cd player (walkman) hook-up so they wont become useless if i lose the ipod.
 ( the wall hook up also comes with many different adapters )

"I was replacing a portable Sony devise that I really liked, but busted one of the speakers. This is a very attractive unit, with excellent sound. I can even plug in my mini disc player. It is very portable with a nice black bag. I was very pleased at the sound of this small unit. Includes earphones, an adapter to play other devises besides IPODS and Universal outlet (powers up the IPOD while playing)...also runs on 4 AA batteries."

I purchased these speakers in order to be able to have some music on an upcoming vacation, and boy was I happy. the speakers fold up into a very compact size and even come with it's own case.  The extra adapter plugs allowed us to it in French Polynesia to charge our ipod, and since the speakers work with 220 voltage I did not even have to get a converter.  Outside of the hotel room we used batteries for power without any problems.  Most importantly the sound quality is great!!!

I am a graduate student in linguistics working with an indigenous language in Oaxaca.  I brought this speaker set to Mexico with me this year as a replacement for a bulky Panasonic cassette transcriber.  It worked like a dream.  Instead of using cassettes for transcription we used mp3s recorded on an Edirol digital recorder.  Instead of a transcriber we used a laptop with windows media player and these Altec Lansing speakers.  The sound quality was perfect for transcription, and the whole package was lighter and easier to manage than a transcriber.  In my down time I got to listen to music.  Can't beat that

This review is a little long-winded, but I am going to share with you my experiences after burning hundreds of DVDs.  After all, many of us are archiving data / video we will want to be able to access for decades into the future and currently there are no other reviews for this product on the site.

I have used just about every type of recordable DVD media available and have concluded Fuji offers the best value.  I recommend you stick with the Fuji DVD-Rs made in Japan.  This is important since there are multiple manufacturers who make recordable DVDs for Fuji (not uncommon in the industry).  For the end user, the DVDs from the different manufacturers (all under the Fuji name) look nearly identical.  

You might want to take the time to Google and then download a free utility program named DVD Identifier.  You simply put your recordable DVD into your computer's DVD writer and DVD Identifier will tell you who actually manufactured the DVD (many of you might be surprised the brand name on the disc and the actual manufacturer are often different).   

For example, the Fuji DVDs made in Japan are made by Taiyo Yuden (one of - if not the most  - reputable manufacturers out there).  The Fuji DVDs made in Taiwan are made by an entirely different manufacturer.   Both the Japan and Taiwan Fuji DVDs look nearly identical in packaging and share a common proof of purchase code.  However, one set will note made in Japan under the proof of purchase code and the other set will note made in Taiwan under the proof of purchase code.  The other way to distinguish between the packages is the made in Japan DVDs will have the plastic spindle cover flush against the black spindle base.   The made in Taiwan DVDs will have the black base stick out slightly. 

I have heard some people say digital is digital and all DVDs are created equal.  This is not true.  You want to buy a DVD that is manufactured with quality.  You might save a few cents buying a cheaper DVD; however, you have to factor in bad burns and lost data.  With the cheapo DVDs, you will have more coasters and more DVDs that initially burn fine, but lose the data after a few months.  

In the past two years, I have burned over 1,000 of the made in Japan Fuji DVDs and have only six bad burns and have not yet experienced lost data from any of the hundreds of successful recordings.      

I use these Fuji DVDS more than any other brand.  I also use the Panasonic DVD-Rs (also manufactured by Taiyo Yuden) as well as unlabeled DVDs from an online wholesaler that are also manufactured by Taiyo Yuden.  The Fuji DVDs have an attractive silver color top, the Panasonics have an attractive gold color top.  The Panasonic DVDs are also much more expensive than the Fujis. 

In terms of compatibility, I have played the Fuji DVDs on over 20 different DVD players and have yet to find a player that does not play my video recorded on a Fuji DVD.

The 50 pack Fuji spindle regularly goes on sale for $20 at a variety of retailers.

Like the other reviewer, I also have a NEC dvd drive. 

I've tried Sony, Memorex, Verbatim, Maxell, and TDX discs but none compare to Fuji. I've also tried generic ones but was 
p-o'ed every time I got another unintended frisbee. 
One brand in particular, mentioned earlier, would not "hold" what I wrote on the disc. On the first day, the disc was fine, go back to it in a month, the data is gone! The others would burn fine but more times than not, the quality of the picture would be downgraded, the video skiped, jumps, etc. And yes, I thought so too but nope, it happened on more than 5 dvds I tested.

Thank goodness I found these at the store -- on sale! What the heck, I'll give it a try. Can't get much worse. I gotta say, Fuji is all I use now. I haven't even gotten 1 coaster and I'm on my 4th 100 pack! I archive movie and picture files and the picture quality is as good as the first day. 

I highly recommend these! Spend a little more and get the quality and longevity you'd expect from writing on your dvds. Don't risk seeing your data one day, gone the next.

I got this for free (after main-in rebates) when I bought NEC-3500A DVD-rw drive last Xmas time.  I started using these very recently (15 days back or so).  I have burned about 25 DVDs so far and all of them came perfect.  Not a single item is wasted etc.  May be some of the credit goes to NEC DVD-RW drive.  I am very happy with it - so, I got another 50 pack from local Fry's for about $20.00.

Luckily, I didn't pay a penny for the motorized SkipDr. as it was given to us as a "prize." I have the original (manual) SkipDr. which worked every time, and I always end up using it instead. It has more than paid for itself in repaired CD's--$20 for an entire kit at a wholesale club that came with spare sanding discs and the whole shebang.

The motorized version didn't come with any deep scratch sanding pads, which I need about 25% of the time for a badly scratched disc. Most of the time the automatic sensor fails to detect that a disc is even in the machine, and won't start turning, so I have to squeeze it together to make it work

I just ran my first (and last) cd through the Scratch repair system and it made the disk look worse than when I started.  Didn't take off any of the scratches and the scratch remover actually made dozens of perpendicular marks of its own.  It really is worse than when I started.

First off, I don't give 5's for anything.  If you expect this remote to be able to duplicate your other remotes based on a predetermined code for the manufacturer of your equipment, it won't happen.  It works for some but not all and didn't recognize most of mine correctly.  However, it has the ability through computer hookup to learn all of the functions that any of your remotes have.  Takes some practice and bravado but will work.  My wife loves it and won't let me put the multiple remotes back on the coffee table.  If you are computer literate this thing is amazing.  The two downsides are 1) It is heavy.  You're not likely to hold it in one hand while lying on the couch and flipping around.  It pretty much has to sit on a table.  2) The keys that appear on the RM-AX4000 screen can not be renamed so if a key name doesn't match one on your remote, you'll have to remember what you programed the key to do

I will make this review very simple.  No matter what features you find attractive about this remote, its shear size makes the thing clunky and unuseable.  Unless you have large hands, you will have trouble accessing all the buttons without 2 handing it. (make sure you go to a retail store and hold it first before you buy it)

In terms of features, the remote has only the simplest of "learning" features.  If you want a custom interface for a piece of hardware it doesn't have a code for.... good luck

This remote is so hard to use and setup. The Xpress functions don't work properly and when used switches to different inputs each time. Most of the interaction with the remote is done on the touch screen so you have to look for the buttons, instead of being able to memorize their locations with your fingers. Get something else

This remote does its job well. I had eight remotes to control the gear in my living room, and this thing took the place of all of them. I no longer lose them in the couch or forget where I put them last...and it no longer takes me five minutes to set up just to watch a movie or listen to music. Macros allow one button press to turn on (or off) all required equipment and set them to the correct mode. The backlight is pleasant, I like the audio feedback of button presses, and the sheer size of the thing feels good in my hands and prevents misplacement.

That being said, this thing was a royal pain to get working properly right out of the box. This may be because I have some less mainstream A/V equipment, but the previous reviews do not exaggerate the PC program interface with its endless mouse clicking. Even the so-called "wizard" has multiple mouse clicks for one simple button, which can get very tedious if you have a remote with 40 buttons on it, like for a reciever. 

Here's a recommendation: skip through the initial wizard as fast as you can, then make a new profile and start out in advanced mode. Even if you go through the wizard, most of your time will probably be spent in advanced mode anyway, because you have to tweak alot buttons to get them working. This may save you much time and headache. This is also where you program macros, the shining star of this remote.

Software installation is straightforward. The interface, aside from the points mentioned above, is relatively simple. You can drag and drop components to pick the order you want them to show up on the screen. Everything is clearly labelled and easy to read. Macros are simple too, but only after you get the buttons working properly.

It took me a couple of hours to get it to do all Dish Network remote commands. After manually programming each button for the DVR, I had to make a macro to get to "My Recordings" with one button press, and it took a few tries to get it to do page up and page down when browsing the guide.

The remote itself has a nice finish, and weighs about like a largish paperback book in your hands. The touchscreen is large enough to poke at it without worrying about hitting the wrong button. The physical buttons are responsive and do not feel cheap or "clicky". After some use, fingerprints show up on the touchscreen, especially when eating popcorn. However, the display is bright enough when backlit that they aren't really a distraction. The menu tree is easy to learn and get used to as well.

This remote would get five stars if it weren't for the subpar PC interface and sparse documentation. The actual remote is fantastic however, and well worth the time and effort it takes to get it up and running. Just make sure you burn a CD with a copy of your profile once you get it going!

My husband told me he would like a Sony RM-AX4000 Home

approached, I realized I couldn't remember what it was
he'd asked for, so I asked him again.  I was nearly out of
time to locate this product, but I checked Amazon.com and
they had them listed.  I ordered one and had it shipped
quickly, but I didn't think it would be in time for him to
open on Father's Day.  The package arrived on Saturday, the
day before Father's Day, and Amazon saved the day for me.

Thank you Amazon, for all that you do!

This is a great remote, but the software that comes with it is some of the worst I have ever seen published by an international company.  
Be SURE to download version 1.1 of the software as the remote still ships with 1.0.  It is slightly less painful to use.

I ordered the SimpleTech 1GB CF for my Canon Digital Rebel XT because the price was great and because I had read that SimpleTech made Canon-labeled cards. 

Two weeks after placing my order, with no word from SimpleTech and no tracking number, I contacted SimpleTech via the Amazon website. I got a very prompt response explaining that they never received the order from Amazon (some technical glitch) but to make it up to me, they would refund my shipping charges and send the card overnight.

The card arrived as promised. I put it in my camera and... nothing. I put it in a card reader and got an error. I contacted SimpleTech tech support through their website and got a very prompt response saying that the card was dead and they would gladly replace it. They sent me a UPS shipping label for the return and a few days later I had a new card.

The new card works perfectly and, although the fates conspired against me, I would definitely recommend SimpleTech to anyone looking for an affordable, top-notch product. Their customer service was extremely quick in responding and they replaced the defective card quickly and without hassle

This is a great card to use for your 8 megapixel digital camera. I have the OLYMPUS C8080, and at the highest-quality camera settings, I can get 254 color shots from this card. SimpleTech is my favorite brand, because I've never had any of their cards fail on me, even after repeated washings. Oops.

This CF Card is totally dependable. SimpleTech is pricey, but you're paying for quality, which is cheaper in the long run.

I had a 512 simpletech card, and loved it.  I got this 1gb card a week ago and it has worked great.  The 512 card was used very heavily for nearly 2 years, and so I purchased from simpletech again.  The card maxs out the meter which suggests how many pictures I have remaining to take, unless it is on the highest setting.  It says I can fit roughly 950 pictures from this 3.0mp camera on the highest settings, but I have not been able to take that many yet!  Batteries only last for 300 pictures, so I probably don't need a card this big.  It is nice for videos though, and it can hold about 15-20 minutes of video at 640x480 15fps.  It also seems to write very quickly.  Much quicker than my lexar card.  For most users, I would suggest having 2x512 cards rather than 1x1gb.  Don't keep all your eggs in 1 basket

I purchased this card for a Canon A95 digital camera, primarily because Canon sells this card at their website and because I read somewhere that SimpleTech makes the cards that come with (some?) Canon digital cameras. 

You can read about the card's specifications elsewhere, just let me say that this is my second SimpleTech card (I also have a 256 MB SD card that I use in a HP 49G+ calculator), and both cards work as well as advertised.  I will definitely buy from SimpleTech again.

The advantage of this surge protector-power strip is that there is a 2 outlet phone jack surge protector on board. I actually had a modem blow out due to a surge, and it came through the telephone line. Now I use a tel-surge protector so I don't have to unplug my phone when a storm is brewing. Note that most surge protectors (baring the kind with huge capacitors) cannot protect against lightning hits, but surges from power problems coming over the lines are common, especially in summer, and these devices can help

If a disk works and gives me a clear picture and clear sound, it is all that I ask for.  For the size of the disk compared to the price, I just don't know how you could beat this product.  In my opinion, SanDisk is one of the best.  Never have had a problem with the SanDisk brand

the one gig sd card works better than i thougt it would. it is by far the cheapest one i've ever found and i'll probably get another one soon.
FYI: i use the card in my nikon digital camera. with the pics set to 6 megapixals and using the uncompressed format(approx 1.8 meg ea.), i have 190 pics and 10 short 1 min movies and the card is about 80 percent full. 

that is awesome...........barny

I bought a 1GB with my new camera because I was giving my other camera and it's 256 memory card to my sister.  The smaller card would fill quickly and I'd have to develope the pictures or deleat them.  I paid about $9.00 more for my card in Sept., and thought that was a deal.  Now, you can get this card for $20.00.  That's a steal for a 1 GB.  also, I like the little case provided to keep the card safe when I take it to the store to develope the pictures.  Love it

I use this storage card in my Canon SD 600.  Get 968 MB of useable space on my camera.  A 1GB card is necessary for people who want to take lots of pictures and not fuss with downloading.  Only complaint that these cards are still a little pricy and hope that it continues to come down in price

I have been trying to find a way to easily carry a lot of camera equipment for quite some time. I have tried backpacks, shoulder bags, duffel bags, but none of them really worked all that well. Then I saw the Lowepro Street and Field system with completely customizable pouches, vests, belts, and accessories. It works great, you only get the pouches you need so there is no waisted space and you can organize them however you want according to how often they are used (put frequently used items in easier to access places.) 

The variety alone of this system is worth the investment, but the quality and ease of use is also very high which is a big plus. You can get a case for any lens, camera body, or accessory you have. I even have cases for my cell phone and water bottle. One word of caution, be sure to measure your lens with the lens hood on backwards if you use them to make sure that the entire thing will fit into the pouch, because sometimes the lens will fit, but then the lens with the lens hood will not. I often carry 5-6 lenses, extension tubes, teleconverters, extra memory cards and batteries, and a bunch of cleaning supplies and other gadgets, which weights a ton. But when they are evenly distributed on this vest/belt Lowepro system it is actually very manageable. 

The only down side is that everyone will be staring at you because you have thousands of dollars of camera equipment strapped to your body. But if you can overlook that, this is the way to go. I have used this system at many zoos without ever having problems, in fact just unzipping a single lens and switching seems safer to me than opening an entire bag of equipment every time you want to switch lenses. Many of the cases also come with a built in rain/snow cover so if the weather changes all of your equipment is not destroyed. You can also put just a few pouches on a normal belt when you are just going to take photos in the back yard or don't need to take all of your equipment, which is nice. I really can't say enough about how much easier this makes traveling with a lot of equipment, if you have been hopelessly searching for a better solution, consider this, you won't regret it.

I have two Ni-MH chargers and sony batteries won't charge in them. They probably use some proprietary technology to prevent using other brand chargers. They force you to buy their own non-standard charger that probably won't again charge other brand batteries. And of course this is not mentioned anywhere. No wonder these batteries are the cheapest. Don't waste your money or support Sony's attempt to bring non-standard products into a standardized market. Soon we have to carry bunch of chargers instead of the good old times when just one was enough

Just wanted to echo what others have said, that these batteries seem to really last.  I received a new camera and was using generic rechargeable batteries in it, almost as powerful as the 2500s here, and the batteries ran out after a few hours.  Replaced those batteries with these, and these just seem to last on and on.  Am very happy with them

I bought these for my Sony digital camera and I am very pleased with them.  Exact fit into the camera and with great capacity, they simply seems to last forever, so running out of power is no longer an issue for me.  The sliding case is a nice touch for storing and transporting your batteries.  Highly recommended

These batteries are far stable and durable in long term use. I have owned non-brand name and Kodak rechargeable batteries. They are either unstable voltage output or die out much earlier than their publicized life-span. Sometimes one in pair die out then other remains(Not SONY). I can't use them for the digital camera power source because it requires delicate and stable voltage supply.

Those SONY batteries seemed not to go down voltage levels and when their charge are drained, the pair(2 batteries) go down together. 
It's perfect use for an equipment that needs constant and stable power supply, like digital camera

This was the best deal I found on rechargable NiHM batteries and that too these are made in Japan by Sony. It has a capacity of 2300mAh. I do not think it gets any better than this.

I would suggest anyone looking out for good NiMH batteries to go ahead and buy these

The reason I love this printer is because of its ease of use, and that's due to it's number one feature - TV output.  I've had a tendency in the past to neglect photo printing because once I get our pictures onto my computer, I want to fiddle with them endlessly to "improve" them before I print them out.  In the end I never do get around to it.  Now we'll come home from a day of photo shooting, look at our pics on the TV and print out the good ones - then I can touch up the photos that need it at my leisure.  And if I am too lazy to even do that, it's simple enough for someone else to take over, meaning it's much more likely to get done. It was great coming back from a Hawaiian vacation with my family and printing out pictures that day for them to take home!

This printer doesn't get 5 stars because of photo quality vs. cost of goods.  You can get the printing packs for half a buck per photo, but professional printing will cost less.  The photos from pros will usually look better too.  While this is a dye sublimation printer, it only uses three colors of ink, so better inkjets, dye-subs and professional prints will have better colors than this machine.  Based purely on tech specs this one should beat out most of the cheaper inkjets (including other stand alone photo printers in the same price range) but I haven't seen any side-by-side comparisons.  On the plus side, the Sony does "print" a transparent layer over the picture that'll keep it from fading for quite a while.  As for my personal opinion of the printouts (as a casual pic taker with a Canon SD500), I would give them an A-/B+.  The colors could be a bit more vibrant, but I have also been surprised by just how much they will pop in a good pic.  Ultimately however I feel that the convenience of having everyone sitting on the couch and picking out the photos they want through the television means the minor cost/quality issue becomes inconsequential, because without that convenience those pictures might never see the light of day in any form.

Overall I would recommend this unit to friends who do casual printing and want something that is very simple to use.  I've even considered sending one to my mother for Christmas.  While the interface as a whole is perhaps not quite as intuitive to use as an ipod, anyone who isn't scared by a cellphone or basic computer use should be able to handle it easily.  It's also flexible, taking a variety of card formats and providing different options for choosing the pictures you want to print - though I would be surprised if you ever used anything but the TV out.  And ultimately I think that anyone who gets it will be printing more photos than before. 

Finally, a couple of notes for those who decide to take the plunge.  Don't count on finding the 3.5x5 paper easily, I haven't seen it anywhere.  ALL of the 4x6 paper is "postcard paper" - I was a bit confused at first looking for "normal" 4x6 packs.  The paper has tear-off edges on the left and right - it's micro-perforated so you wont get any rough edges, but it's a bit of a pain to tear off without "fingerprinting" or creasing the photo.  Enjoy

I just received my printer tonight and could not wait to try it out. I have had a Sony digital camera for over two years, and have only been able to print pictures via my regular inkjet printer. I decided to purchase this photo printer so I could get much clearer, better quality pictures. I love that this printer allows you to print from a Memory Stick without having to connect the printer to your computer. It could not be easier. Just insert the memory stick in the printer and you are set to go. It was extremely easy to set up, and it comes with trial paper and ink. I have only used it to print out 6 pictures, but thus far I am very happy with my purchase. The photo's are extremely clear. They look like I took them to a high quality lab to have them developed

This printer is wonderful and the picture quality is superb and they are so clear.  I have a Cybershot T-1 camera and the combination is nice.  The printer speed was quick too! I couldn't believe how easy it was to connect the printer to the TV and view the pictures that I had stored on my camera and edit the pictures using a remote control.  I would recommend this printer because of the easy setup, quick printing speed, and excellent quality of the pictures

This mouse is great for laptop use on the go. It comes with me everyday on the train and on buses on my way to work, and still works with no problems after a couple of drops and banging into things. My only complaint is the dimensions on this page are way off. The mouse is very small, for my hands I basically use it with 2 fingers, but it works great!

I have used this mouse for 3 months with my laptop.  Look/feel and general use are fine for short periods of time (~&lt; 1 hour).  However, I am currently shopping for a replacement as this mouse has one problem:  Intermittently, after clicking/double-clicking, the mouse will go into a "move to the left" mode...and will continue to move until it reaches the edge of the screen.  Sometimes it will move to the upper-left.  This is so inconsistent as to be unpredictable.  I will often (at least 10 times in a 30 minute period) have to give the mouse a wiggle to stop it from continuing.  Frustrating if you are trying to click through a multi-level menu, for instance.  Another example is if you working on any CAD-type or image editing project where you need to insert a line one segement at a time (mouse will move when it feels like it).

It was ok for a while, but now it is annoying...going to buy a replacement.

If I have to buy a replacement for a product because of how the product performs at an early stage in its life, it gets no more than 2 stars.  It could be just this one particular mouse, but then that points to lack of QA at the manufacturer end...again, 2 stars

I was surprised how tough these little critters are.  I got it initially because I did some travelling and needed something small and light.  My 2 boys (3 and 5) started using it (because it fits their hands) to play games and I wasn't sure how long it was going to last and they can be very rough with it.  You know little kids when they get excited or frustrated with computer games! To my surprised, its been nearly a year and it is still alive and well and they used it most every day!  I bought my wife one and she loves it and I ended up getting an extra one for myself for travel purposes.  Yes, it may be a little small for my hand but not totally uncomfortable and it does its job.  I even used it through one complete code/programming project

I purchased this for my laptop. It worked great at first. There were blue and red lights that would brighten up when it was awake. Not anymore. The blue light completely stopped working. It used to be plug and play. Not anymore. Basically it is useless. It just doesn't work. It was used probably 30 times at the most. Complete junk. I like the smallness and shape of it though. Time to try a different brand

On a full battery It was able to run for about 5-10mins with my 32' CRT tv and 19' LCD monitor + comp. Good enough for me to power down the computer, would last longer if the TV was off im sure

I've had a pair of EX71SL's for over a year, and the sound is great.  The bass is pronounced and is probably not suitable for true audiophiles.  However, it is just right for me.  I find the midrange and treble to be appropriate.

I have a pair of Grado SR-80 headphones, and a pair of Sony MDR-V6 headphones.  Each is a $100 conventional full-sized set of headphones, and yet I actually prefer the sound of the Sony earbuds.

The only problem I have is that the cord is far too short without the extension, and far too long with the extension.  (A free and extremely long extension cord comes with the phones.)  What were they thinking?  Also, the fact that the right ear's cord is so much longer than the left's is ridiculous.  Don't they have a focus group review these things?

I've been using these earbuds for several months now, and they're far better than the ones that come with the iPod. They're more comfortable, and there's so much more bass, although as everyone else pointed out you have to push them way into your ears to get the bass.

My pair has gone through the washing machine twice and the dryer once, and they still sound just as good as the day I got them! (I did have to glue one of the earpieces back together, though.) I thought I'd certainly destroy them by getting them wet, but these things are industrial strength

I read all of the reviews here and thought these would be the best option for easy transport AND low ambient sound i-pod headpohones without breaking the bank (I'm on a plane frequently). I wanted something that I wouldn't cry over breaking or losing during my many travels. I found that the uneven cord lengths are very irritating- especially if you like to use only one plug (like maybe at your desk at work). The weight of the shorter cord pulls on the longer cord and it is quite uncomfortable- even when sitting still. So then I thought these will be great workout headphones (won't be upset if I break or lose them), HOWEVER, the cords produce noise in the ear pieces everytime they rub on your clothing or your hand. The effect is very loud and disruptive to your music listening experience (even when you are sitting stationary at your desk). It is similar to wearing a stethescope, which defeats the point of wearing in-the-ear headphones (which are supposed to reduce the ambient noise). I do not recommend these headphones, because of this stethescope effect- I could get over the uneven cord lengths for certain uses (they are after all designed to wear behind the head). I'm on the hunt for better quality headphones

Once again I'm amazed at how the reviews were so highly in favor of this product.  These are terribly uncomfortable (for my ears) and don't really provide that great of listening experience. The frequency response seems muted until you use the largest possible "surrounds", and then they become distractingly uncomfortable.  But of course, this is just my experience, your mileage may vary, as they say.  Personally, I found my Apple iPod 'phones to be better

I am a mild audophile, and I love these headphones. They have great base response, treble, and isolation. If you listen to music on the bus on train while listening for your stop, don't get get these! You won't be able to hear a thing outside of the music

Like I said above, I am on my second pair of these.  The first pair made it over two years of daily 5 mile workouts on an eliptical crosstrainer.  Believe me they held up well considring they got sweat soaked almost every day of their life.  These phones really bring out the bass beat and are for the money some of the best sounding headphones on the market.  When this pair wears out, I will get some more.  They are light years ahead of the cheap foam covered earbuds in sound and comfort.  You don't even realise you are wearing headphones with these on

I bought this and other sony headphones (noice cancelling).  I travel sometimes because my work and I prefer use the Fontopia headphones because they are small and the sound quality is good.  In addition, they isolate the outer noise enough good due to their design.

The small case is nice and protect them from scratches...

I recommend this product.

I recently purchased an Alienware computer with a Dell 30" monitor and wanted speakers to match.  I wanted very loud speakers to shake the walls when I play games or watch DVD's.  These speakers are the loudest I have tried.  The shake the walls and house with great sound.  Some important "pro" features I really like:
1- the speaker cables are clips rather than RCA plug type- in other words, I can use my own speaker cable (I need long ones to route the surround speakers) to make it a professional installation (all wires hidden).
2- each speaker volume is adjustable.  Because of my room size, i manually turned up the surround speakers volume to balance the sound coming from the front.  
3- the remote is really cool to adjust volume quickly, just point and turn it up

As most anyone will tell you, these speakers do have excellent sound and if you're just going to set them up on your desktop, then I'd give them 5 stars.  However, the design for wall mounting these is horrible and you can't ceiling-mount them.  Logitech does not make separate mounts for these and no "universal speaker mounts" will work with them.  If you want to see how they mount, go to Logitech's website, go to product support and enter wall mounting.  Some might argue that they're computer speakers, not home entertainment center speakers, but for $300, I expect a little bit better design

You really can't go wrong with this one.  Not great response but what do you expect for less than $300?  On the other hand, The possibilities for this surround system are endless.  Want something just for the effects to complilment your bedroom wide screen?  How about using it for a dedicated gaming sound system, (this is how my daughter has it configured).  It's our second one.  First one died as a result of recent electrical storm, (Yes the circuit was 'protected', but so what).  Couldn't be happier for the investment

The Logitech Z5500 speaker set is one of the best deals around... You get all of the features and benefits of a dolby digital decoder, true sourround sound and a digital control unit. Sound is fantastic- You may find that tweaking the equalizer settings on your media player/sound card will greatly improve and balance the sounds output.

The best part... It can play loud, too! Cranking it up to its full potential produces deep, rich pounding bass, without even making the amplifier's heat sink very hot to the touch!

A best buy!

this system is perfect if you like loud base and want alot of power out of your speakers.  But these speakers aren't as clear as it i thought it would be from reading the reviews.  i had a BOSE Companion 2 and i think those speakers sounds better than these, but they do lack base and loudness.  but overall i am pretty satisfied with these...

I am using this system instead of component audio to do with my new hi def TV. i can't believe the quality of sound that comes out. I would have paid 3x what this system cost to buy it in pieces and the sound would be roughly the same.

I would recommend these for whatever use you have. They rock. Literally

After going through more than ten different manufactures of DVD+R media I have to say I have had the best results with these.  Close to 100% burn rate with excellent playback on most players, except Sony, (though I'm using a Sony burner).  One batch had some duds at the end of the cake and Amazon replaced the whole thing promptly

I rarely write reviews but I could not believe what I saw with the "24 DVD" players and it doesn't work.  All I ever use are Verbatim DVD's and I burn on both a Mac and a Windows-based unit.  The Windows DVD's play fine in my Mac and vice-versa.  Also, I have two Sony DVD players, a PS2, and my roomies Zenith DVD player, none of which have a problem playing the discs.  If you "truly" had problems with 24 DVD players, I am wondering if you just got a bad disc.  I have been burning copies of my older DVD's, this weekend alone having done 7, with not a coaster.  On my 2nd 50 pack in under a month, and only have had one problem (which was my fault anyhow).  Verbatim's, in my opinion, are the best media available, in both DVD-R and DVD DL

When I first got my Sony dvd burner I had numerous failure with burns. I tried several different brands of blanks with the same problem, big stacks of failed burns. When I called Sony to complain they suggested I use Verbatim. I did and in at least 150 burns I have no failures.  So naturally I'm hooked on Verbatim.  It must be the best

I rarely write a review , but I figure I should on this one. First off, the price was perfect for 100 dvd blanks. Next, the quality of the blanks for burning backups of dvds I have, worked fantastic... although finding the right software to do the deed is tricky at first. Anyhow, I also had to clean house on a 30 gig drive and a laptop so the file transfer worked fine to the dvd's. My only problem was with the shipment itself. It came in some square box...I opened the box to find some paperbags wrapped around a broken dvd container with the blanks barely hanging on. The plastic that incased them was totally shreded and broken. Go figure! They need to work on their shipping skills. Try bubble wrap next time boys and not paper sacks. Other than that, I just needed to burn backups of dvds and get files to dvds so the item itself worked pro. I highly recommend. I don't blame Verbatim for the shipping issues... Go for it

Verbatim is great. not a single coaster till now in abt 60 discs.  I use Nero to perfectly complement the burning process. I was sceptic when i did geta great deal (~25 AR). heard from ppl saying these could be from a different production line. 
Excellent discs would definitely go for em. was always a believer in Ritek Ridata before these. got to get some of those RWs.

Dear Seller, 
The price was good, 
The product was good,
Your delivery was excellent!
But it did not come with even a sample of what it can do!
So what now? I plugged it into my computer, and everything loaded as it usually does, but no games, not even a starter edition.
pardon my ignorance, but even when I registered with Logitech, there was no reference to an actual usuable and downloadable game for this device.
Confused new gamer ( I bought this for my five year old, who is as mystifyed as I am).
This product is NOT a recommend for the novice, such as myself.
Just go out and buy a complete system that has all the bits and pieces included....save time and disappointment.

The relatively inexpensive, well-designed Logitech Nascar wheel and pedals are ANALOG, a MUST for racing games like Need for Speed. Analog potentiometers slide along infinite voltage points between turn-left or right. The wheel suction cups hold snugly for a standard desktop. The pedals tend to slip slightly and may be at a slightly awkward angle, but can easily be mounted to a small, inexpensive piece of hardboard or plywood, or car floormat. You could also design a 1x2 wood slide-into-place framework. The twenty-dollar "Try Me" wheel I returned was DIGITAL (full turn-left or right), as ineffective as using keyboard arrow keys.

I purchased this product for my 3 yr old.  He loves it and it works with most of his computer games to my surprise.  It did not come with instructions, so we're having to self teach ourselves the features.  Surprisingly, I can't get the vibration feature to work with his Nascar game and this is a Nascar race wheel.  The vibration works for his SpongeBob game??

I bought two of these wheels last month and I'm about to order 2 more (I'm setting up a little company picnic racing rally). I played Midnight Run II (windows) with these wheels and didn't experience the force feedback either. However, when I played NASCAR 3 with these wheels, then I got vibrations in the steering wheel when taking turns too tight, but nothing when bumping the wall or another car. The force feedback amounts to a 'humming' vibration and is actually annoying. btw - there's an option in NASCAR 3 you have to turn on for the force feedback to work. The force feedback was just a 'nice' feature for me, but I really got it for the USB connection and table top design. I have a couple of the Interact V3 racing wheels and their 'sit nestled between your legs' design is awkward to deal with and it's too tall to effectively use them on a table. But the LogiTech wheels work great on a table top! The LogiTech connectors are a little more reliable too. The pin connector housing on the V3 snapped off pretty easily on one of the wheels. However, I do prefer V3's full size pedals to the LogiTech smaller pedals... but it's satisfactory

I had no problems burning to these discs, its when I went back a few months later to these discs and found out that none of them work anymore. After further research I found out that Memorex uses the cheapest dye available and thus the DVDs have absolutelly no life to them, my discs started dying after a few months.
In addition, in you physically hold the disc in your hands you can feel how warped physically it has become. This is true for all the discs (about 150 of them). I CAN NOT NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT STRONLY ENOUGH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I had so many bad burns with my first spindle that I had to ask for an exchange.  The new spindle had at least 5 bad burns too.  Also, the edge of the disc wasn't rounded but had a sharp lip on the underside.  Never again will I buy Memorex discs DVD, CD or otherwise

I bought this Belkin Battery Backup after a power failure disaster was narrowly averted by MS Word's AutoRecovery feature.  It's worked fine at warding off power failures since, I haven't really tested how well it does what it's supposed to do.

I do have some comments on usability.  My wife finds the necessity to press and hold the power switch for several seconds counter-intuitive.

I would like the non-battery backup outlets to be controlled by the switch so I could shut everything down for power conservation with one step

Shipping took awhile - but considering the weight of this item I still think it was excellent quick shipping service. The price was excellent - especially since I knew the model I needed beforehand and had priced it on other web sites too. When I need to buy something - I generally loook at Amazon first now.... and seldom need to go any further.

Power UPS! Everything you need to know.

First of all why do you want a power UPS? There are some very good reasons. (1) You never want your machine to go down incorrectly because of a blackout. (2) You want to work with clean power only. (3) You want to monitor your PC power. (4) You want to prevent your PC from being damaged due to a power problem like a lighting strike and want surge protection. The first rule about UPS is to never trust the insurance claim. Get your PC insured elsewhere. These companies have a tendency not to support their insurance claims. I have a PC running some very high specifications with over six USB devices, LCD monitor, printer and Ethernet equipment, with everything on at the same time. I have never gone above 325W of usage and average between 250W and 300W when managing a high spec game and doing lots of background tasks. Even though I have a 400W Power Supply Unit (PSU) I will be upgrading to a 500W PSU because it is better quality model. The way I can monitor how many Watts I use is with UPS software and hardware. So the question you need to ask is how many watts you will be using. The short answer to this is you don't know until you install the UPS and software that tells you how many watts you use because that appears to be the only way you can monitor your wattage at this time. You need to estimate what it is. I would say a high-end domestic PC (not a server) would use 300W max if it has one of every device you can think off turned on. As soon as we add things like another PC, or several printers, or several monitors, then we can start to overload a 325W UPS. This brings us to the first thing we need to learn about any UPS - Overloading and balancing. The overload feature is a warning system that turns on when you have overloaded the UPS capacity. Overloading does two things. It can in theory eventually damage the UPS and it voids the warranty. Most UPS are 325W but there are 800W - 1000W and even greater models out there for home networks that use more than one PC setup but to be honest you are probably going to get a UPS per PC setup rather than expensive bigger UPS for a network. So check the UPS rating. What UPS you choose depends on how much you want to load on it. Next thing you need to check with the UPS is if it comes with a USB connection. If it does this is a big plus because it means you can control it from your PC and the UPS comes with software. Now if the UPS has this feature then you can do loads of stuff like turning off UPS sound alarms, controlling how your UPS handles a blackout, how long it uses the battery before shutdown or hibernation, if it sounds an alarm or not, if it run self tests, data collection and monitoring, notifications and sensitivity settings. If the UPS does not come with a USB connection and software then you probably should be looking for an UPS designed for computer use rather than a UPS for non-computer equipment. Most UPS have LED indicators that tell you the status of the unit. The next thing to understand is that testing your UPS is not done by breaking it out of the box, connecting it to the mains, plugging your PC in and then turning off the house's power with the circuit breaker. You must charge the UPS first! So read the instructions. Usually you must attach the battery to the UPS (plug it in firmly!) and wait before using it. Then perform the test using the software first! Then you can consider trying to simulate a blackout in your home to see if the PC stays up. Usually a UPS is programmed to shutdown your PC if the blackout lasts for a few seconds. Nearly all UPS models with a USB connection can be customized for the shutdown event or how long the PC should hold for on the UPS battery. Most UPS devices allow you to connect a modem phone line into the device and then run a phone line into your modem. This is important because power surges on a UPS that do not have this protection can damage a PC through the unprotected phone line running into the modem that usually runs to the PC somehow. This is nasty problem with the degree of security that a UPS can provide. If it doesn't have this function then it is not going to provide 100% surge protection with a PC that is on-line. Networking a UPS PC to another PC without UPS can also increase the risk of surge protection problems. It is not recommend that you network a UPS PC to a non-UPS PC unless surge protection and the warranty are not an issue. One last thing is that some UPS have input regions on the UPS for surge protection and other input regions are not surge protected. Also with some models the batteries need to be replaced after a few years if you end up using them a lot. This is everything you need to know about an UPS before you choose one. It is basically now about downloading the technical specs of the UPS and making sure it provides you with what you need. The two top brands are APC and Belkin

Pros: Three customizable video profiles (movies, broadcast TV...); Excellent brightness and contrast; good viewing angles L & R of center; Generous input options;

Cons: Big, centered on/off button cries out for my toddler to turn it on/off/on/off. Finally put a 35Lb barbell in front of it.

The biggest con has not to do with the TV but the dearth of HD content. Others' comments about broadcast TV looking horrible on HD sets cannot be overemphasized. Same for DVDs on SD DVD players. On the latter note, buy a good upcoverting DVD player (&lt;$150); the visual results were simply outstanding.

Also note that you will need to run component video at a minimum, HDMI preferred; Using S-Video or composite is a complete waste of money you spent on the TV. So the other 'con' is that you will probably need a new A/V receiver and cables.

So to recap, if you want a good experience, you need an HD TV, upconverting DVD player, A/V receiver with component or better yet HDMI connections, and HD broadcast content (cable or satellite). This is not a cheap endeavor

Buyer be ware if you have a problem with delivery or the TV you will be left on your own to sort it out. Amazon may or may not be a big trust worthy company, but they will still leave it to you to sort out there is no personal customer service other then email (run around)!! Bare that in mind before making any large purchase, may be better to pay a little more through a company with a store front at least you will have someone to complain to face to face or take the item back

The TV is really nice.  It works easily.  I have it hooked up to a cable network.  My friend also bought one about a week earlier and I liked hers, so I ordered mine. I would recommend it to anyone who wants a first class HDTV.  The service is quick and efficient.  The picture is fantastic

The service from Amazon was great, delivery people were most cooperative, made delivery as promised, placed TV in space where we wanted and hooked up and checked it out.
They even offered to take away the empty carton. We saved about $250 by buying from Amazon rather than from local retailer

Wonderful picture quality in HD. DVD displays well too. Standard cable signal not really much difference. Would recommend this tv to anyone. Just understand that you need HD programming for this tv to really shine. The audio of this tv is ok, nothing special, but it gets the job done. I have it hooked up to a surround sound and love it

I should first note that I am no expert on television sets, and was more than a little confused by all the different technologies out on the marketplace.  After some research, and a little help from a local home theater company, I settled on this TV.  If 13" of depth isn't an issue for your application, this TV offers picture quality on par with the more expensive plasmas and lcds.  Couldn't be happier with my purchase

The previous reviews are similar to mine.  All one has to do is watch the Discovery HD Theater  and immediately they will realize what a great TV it is, but also the picture quality is sharp,color is beautiful and the TV is not 300 pounds in weight. I enjoy my 42" Samsung DLP HDTV WAY MORE than I ever realized possible

You may as well pitch the instructions because they're worthless (and the only reason I'm not giving a 5-star rating for the ADS Tech Video Xpress).  I was about ready to pitch the product as well, after losing two evenings trying to figure out how to get it to work.  Ultimately, I gave up on relying solely on the program it came with, and I instead opted to try it on my Windows Movie Maker.  Yahoo!  Perseverance paid off!  Once I switched to Movie Maker, this tool worked great!  

To date, I've converted about a dozen videos of content to computer files that I was able to burn to DVDs.  I just leave my Xpress hooked up to the back of my television so I don't have to try to remember later how to hook it up again.  Doing that, I can connect my laptop to the Xpress and start the video converting process within 3-4 minutes.  My Movie Maker program takes over the entire process.  

The ADS Tech Video Xpress has been especially useful for me because I teach a college telecourse and often show edited video clips to my students.  Before purchasing Xpress, I had crudely edited videos that I was reluctant to use; my videos had lots of amateur stop/start points.  Using Movie Maker with Xpress, I was able to download these videos to my laptop, then easily edit them so transitions between stop and start points became smooth and seamless.  

Pretty cool.  I'm glad I took a chance on this product!

Below are hook-up and program instructions I've written to myself for easy reference later.  Hopefully they'll be of more help to you than the instructions that come with this product:

First, hook up the Video Xpress equipment as follows:
1.  S-cable (buy one, since it doesn't come with the VideoXpress) goes from the back of your television to the VideoXpress.  
2.  Use red/white/yellow cords running into the back of the VCR/DVD that is hooked up to your televion as follows:
- all three plug into the "video out" column
- all three plug into the VideoXpress tool at the other end.  
3.  The USB plug for the VideoXpress tool plugs into the back of the computer.

Next, open the Instant Video Xpress program and verify the settings are as follows:
- "NTSC M" for the video standard setting
- "640 x 480" and "60 FPS (VGA)" for video format
- "DVD, VCR, TV" for video source
- "Video composite" for video input

Under the program advanced settings:
- Low motion (TV, VCD, DVD)
- CPU support: "SSE3"
- Stereo system: "MTS"
- Video decoder: "video standard: NTSC_M"

Under properties within the program advanced settings:
- Stream format:  Video format: "NTSC_M"
- Frame rate: "59.940"
- Color space/compression: "YUY2"
- Outputs size: "640x480"

Finally, CLOSE the Instant Video Xpress program.  (Windows Movie Maker can't access the video until this program is closed.  And yes, it's silly to have to open it, make those setting changes, then close it, but Video Xpress won't work correctly unless you follow those setting steps.)

In case you need this information for Windows Movie Maker, the steps (in order) are as follows:
Under "File," click on "capture video."

Use the following settings:
- audio device set at: "USB2.0 Analog Audio Device"
- Video input source set at: "Composite"
Under Configure Video Capture Device:
- Video format: Video standard: "NTSC_M"
		   Frame rate: "29.970"
		   Color space/compression: "YUY2"
		   Output size: "640x480"

Under Camera settings:
- Deinterlace method: "Low motion (TV, VCD, DVD)"
- CPU support: "SSE3"
- Stereosystem: "MTS"

Under Video decoder: Video standard: "MTSC_M"
Signal detected: "1"
Lines detected: "525"
Then...

Give the file a name and indicate where to save it

Set it for "best quality" for playback.

Then "Start Capture."

If the Video Xpress is hooked up and running correctly, you should see on your computer monitor the video image of whatever is showing on television, but you will NOT hear the sound.  When you finish capturing and play it back, THEN you'll hear the sound.

I know, I know -- clear as mud.  But hey, it's better than the Xpress instructions!  :-

I was trying to duplicate HI-8 tapes and the ADS Tech Video Express USBAV-191-EF is not a viable solution.  It drops frames and there are nothing that can be done to improve its recording.  The installation is buggy.  I ended up buying a Sony VRD-MC1 and am extremely happy with it

I bought this to record Tivo DVR stuff to DVD.  Worst frame rate capture and audio capture of .avi's of the four different devices I have tried.  Completely unusable.  The software is a trial version.  Instead, buy the ADS DVDXpress DX2 for a bit more.  Ulead's software is stable, and it's not a trial version.  It is also the only analog capture device I have tried that gives a good picture using mpeg capture.  Pinnacle's Dazzle only is tolerable using avi capture which is great if you have the drive space, but the software is way too buggy

       AA Batteries sure come in handy around here. We have seven battery operated clocks and all seven use AA's. We also have Remote Controls and a small radio plus other items that use AA's. Now you see why I bought this 50 Pack. The expiration date on my 50 pack is December 2011 and I bought  these Batteries from Amazon a few Months ago. For what I use these batteries for; they are holding up great. Priced right too. Definitely worth it!

If you want a budget home theater system for under $200 there is probably not many systems better then the Sony HT-DDW700. This system is ideal for small rooms such as a bed room or a tiny living room.

Considering the price, sound quality is actually better then expected for me. The tiny cube speakers presents pretty good clarity. They may look like cheap computer speakers but they aren't and are a bit heavier then they look. The center channel may be a little underpowered since dialog during dvd movies sound a tad soft and a little too low. The surround effects during movies in dolby digital and dts are very good though.
If set up properly the speakers handle surround effects very well.

Some minor complaints is that the speaker wire attached to the speakers are very thin. They are fixed and can't be replaced. Also, if you want heart stopping bass then this system might not be for you. The 8" subwoofer is okay considering the price of the system. It is currently better then any other sub included in a home theater system under $200. It isn't powered, is very light (only 9 lbs) and you have to be pretty close to actually feel the bass. The volume would have to be cranked up extremely high for the sub to actually rattle your walls. 

The receiver comes with 1 optical and 1 coxial digital input and 4 rca analog inputs. It should be enough in most cases. An extra digtal input or two wouldn't hurt but again the system is under $200. Setup couldn't be easier. You just hook up the included microphone, place it at your listening postion and press a button on the remote. The system will automatically sets up the speaker distance, delay and volume levels. The receiver comes with the basic pro logic II music and move modes to upmix your stereo sources. It also has other sound fields and effects to enhace the sound but they don't really seem to enhance the sound by that much if at all.

Basically, if you want a home theater system for a small room and for under $200 then there isn't much better then the Sony HT-DDW70

I purchased this item recently and it's excellent in all aspects. It took me less than a hour to set it up and the super cool auto calibration takes cares of calibrating the speakers without having the pain of doing it manually. The subwoofer delivers a meaty bass and the surround speakers are very impressive. The centre channel could have been powered up a bit more so that it can deliver the movie dialogues in depth, but still it does a good job. Overall, I would say it's an excellent choice when you compare the cost vs performance

If these were free, i'd still would not recommend them, due to all the time that you will waste with faulty recordings.

It is the discs, I must assume, since my burner works fine with other brands.

Anyway, (now) I think it's best to invest a bit more and get good media..

I have been using Memorex dvd-r blank media for more than a year and have gotten fine recordings with my new dvd player/recorder.  Not all of my recordings were successful, no product I know is 100% perfect, but the majority have been successful with Memorex dvd blank media.
This 50-pack spindle was purchased from Amazon because I know I can rely on them to give you the best in quality and value plus free shipping.   Moreover, I have never really been disappointed with anything purchased from Amazon.   
After trying many dvd-r blank media, I found Memorex dvd-r spindles to be affordable and reliable for a better than average performance.

I see a lot of negative reviews here, but I've been using these discs for a couple months now with my PowerBook G4's Superdrive, and I've had no problems, at least none that I would attribute to the discs themselves.  One review laments Toast Titanium 7, which in my experience is a very finnicky, buggy program.  I too had a number of failed burns with that program, but I was able to remedy the situation by saving my dvd projects as disc images, and then burning them later with disc utility after I had a chance to mount them and check them out.  For the price I payed for these discs, if I remember right, almost half the price of a 25 pack from other companies for a 50 pack from memorex, I am very very pleased.  If you're looking to play around with dvd burning, and I guarantee you you will make a few mistakes and have to throw away a few discs before you get it right, this is the best deal you'll find anywhere

I have used three other brands of 16x DVD-Rs and none of them have been problematic with my new (Tivo) dvd burner. This is the first brand that just hasn't worked. These discs were a waste of time shopping for, they were a waste of time dealing with failed burns, and they were a waste of money. I am not even going to attempt to sell the unopened package in the Amazon marketplace since it wouldn't be fair to other buyers. For your information, I have had no problem with Sony, Fuji, and Verbatim

I've had this drive for a year now and I've burned over 500 dvds. The drive is still going strong, with no signs of giving up. I've had a total of 4 coasters and they've always been the fault of the blank dvds, not the drive itself. Never had compatibility problems with DVDs or CDs and I've even used some manufactured/burned overseas. Memorex, TDK, Fujifilm, Sony, you name it and I've burned it.
If you're looking for a dependable, good performance, cheap drive, look no further

 The burner works well except when burning dual layer discs.  I have colleagues that also have this problem with dual layer discs when using other burners so it's most likely a problem in Nero and not the drive.

All this has been said before but here it is again. Sony 1-8x DVD+R's with "AccuCORE" will burn at 16x. TDK 8x will only burn at 8x. Wherever you buy this buy it OEM. Save the money for a better version of Nero Burning ROM. Bundled retail software is junk. I've had mine for months now and burned most every format on DVDs and Cd's. No coasters. It's quite but you can here it run. It has a busy light. If it's on it's busy. Firmware updates for media are readily available. Present version is 1.06. You can buy this under $50 and it works great with my AMD 1.4Ghz and Windows 98SE.

Very easy to install, I'm not very hardware literate. I have used it to copy music with the cd-r and movies with dvd-r so far no coasters. It has done more than I expected and no problems. My only complaint is it doesn't have light scribe like the European models. Highly reccomend this to anyone looking to upgrade their computer

     I bought this burner for around 40$. I needed to add this for my system, which didnot have the dvd burner part and also needed to backup my information.
     This is easy to install, if you are going to have two drives running, then you need to set up one drive as master and the other drive as slave, the white ide cable that is allready present in your system usually has this labels, usually the top end of the ide white cable is the master and the middle point is the slave. now also connect another power point, at the same end as your previous drive, and you are ready to roll. if your computer doesnot recognise either of the drives, then you need to change the Jumper settings, at the very back of your drive, by the side of the IDE cable slot, you have another small slot whith three pairs of pins, one end of them is covered with a black clip like jumper, you need to change it to the other end, and then restart your comp. Please donot forget to turn the power off.
      Now about this burner, this is an amazing piece, which burns DVDs really silently. It comes with nero 6, software which is easy to use. I didnot need any upgrades of the software, the older version works fine for me.
      The reason i have given it 4 stars only is because it makes a funny noise when it reads my DVDs, funny looking at how silent it is when it burns them. It also will read DVDs that have scratches, and other drives wont recognise.
      All in all this is a very good buy for the price, if it is to be your second drive. And hey it is a NEC, so dont worry.


Update 6 Months Later.
This NEC burner works very well and is very silent when burning the DVDs, infact so silent that initially i wasnt sure if it was actually burning the DVDs. I would recommend Nero software for this burner. All in all a solid buy for the price and performance

I bought this DVD burner because my friends all told me that it was a great burner, and I compared it to other specs of DVD burners without breaking the bank, and by far, this burner was the cheapest and was the fastest of all the cheaper burners I could find.  I can burn a full dvd in 40 minutes, 30 minutes spent reading the disc, and 10 actually writing it.  It works great with my Memorex 16x DVD+R's.  I loved this burner so much, that I bought another one, so I now have two burners in my computer.  I highly recommend this burner and the nero software that comes with it is great

Not quite as powerful as I was hoping for, but the sound is alright and in a small room it'll do fine.

Careful, there is no plug-in at the back, so you can only connect MP3 or auxiliary stuff through the little front jack.

Otherwise it's easy to use and pretty cool-looking... ideal for quiet listening, lame if you host a big party and need loud stuff

You will be surprised how crummy this sounds compared to the Panasonics that cost about the same. This is my main problem - the sound quality sucks compared to the competition out there.

1 - The speakers are lightweight and shoddily built. They sound muddy and the deep bass from them is nothing to write home about. They are fairly light weight - meaning very small magnets in them. These are 3 way speakers - for really good sound on the cheap - speakers need to be 2 way!

2 - The sound input consists of a headphone type jack in FRONT. Not even standard phono inputs at the back.

3 - Its advertised as 320 watts - which is meaningless - since the speakers suck. What good is a high power amp with crappy speakers. And in case you know some audio - 320 watts is only twice as loud as 32 watts (log relationship). For some reason, this is not even half as loud as my 100 W receiver!

4 - No user adjustable equalizer, only presets possible

5 - Cannot connect a different pair of speakers to upgrade because of the "biamping" type of connections.

6 - The receiver sucks - even my Sandisk flash player seems to have a better receiver.

I concur with the other reviewer - Death to Sony! Shame on them for taking consumers for a ride. This company nowadays makes it stuff for ultra cheap and prices it "Competively" with the others - meaning - fat profit margins.

I thought this new model would be a good replacement to my old MHC-GX250 which was a bit big for my new smaller room. But I was the MHCEC70 Minisystem is truely "Mini" and inferior in quality to the older MHC-GX250 which was around $280 and was well worth it. This system does not deliver the 320 Watts compared to my older system which used to blow up the room. Moreover it lacks an auxilary and Game Sync, so you can't hook up your TV, IPOD or XBOX to it..

This is an awesome little system for the size.  It was easy to set up, even for an electronically challenged person like myself.  A lot of fine sound comes out of this compact system.  The price was great and delivered right to my door.  Amazing

...I'm so dissappointed in CaseLogic for discontinuing the hard cases. They were great, a HARD cover with rubberized coating and actual cd case style holders inside (that you pop out with your finger by pressing the center). Somebody could have sat on it and it would've been fine..

Everyone so far is right.  This is a great product to store your dvd's.  You do have to trim the covers to fit.  Beyond that is works perfectly.  I have 3 of them.  I would recomend this to anyone with a large dvd collection

CaseLogic has set the standard for media storage, and this continues the tradition. A few tweaks are needed, however. I am certain that I will soon fill the 20 slots. Therefore, it would be helpful to have a clear plastic sleeve on the spine for inserting a title or index to avoid having to open each case in search of a specific disk. The graphics sleeves are small enough that considerable trimming of the original case graphics is needed. Actually, I would prefer that the DVD companies would make their graphics more easily adaptable to the album rather than the other way around

If you have a lot of DVDs or CDs these wallets are the way to go. I have over 800 CDs and they were eating up my space. After getting rid of all the jewel cases I can store all of my CDs and DVDs on one book shelf. And since I organized them by theme, it is easy to find what I am looking for. By the way: you can mark the outside of the wallets with a  white-out pen. It makes it easy to know what's inside each wallet.  For the DVD wallet you will need to do a little trimming for some of the Liner notes. But it is easy to do. Trust me... once you start using these wallets, you'll love 'em. For what you get with these wallets I find the price fair. Even better here on Amazon.com Enjo

I was scepticle at first that something looking that flimsy could really hold the weight of 622 cds.  The assembly was easy though time consuming.  I would recommend that you use those plastic washers, otherwise if you decide to move the rods you get nasty marks on the wood.  I would recommend this unit  to anyone wanting all of their cds in one spot.  Very stable even on carpet

I am very leery about these flat screen monitors.  However, I am enjoying the Sony very much.  I bought a Pixo, and it blew out in only three months.  Someone told me to get a Sony.  They've had it six years, and nothing happened to it yet. So your reviews are very helpful to me.  Thanks guys

I searched and hunted this monitor for the best price for months.  I first saw this monitor at Best Buy.  I was so impressed with the quality of the picture.  I was sold on "XBRITE", but I hesitated at the price of $399.00.  I watched the ads for months, checked other retail outlets, searched other online retailers, and went back to Best Buy on several occations to see this monitor, hoping I could catch this item as an "Open Box Item".
  
I am very happy with this monitor.  Set up was a breeze, connect, plug in, and go.  When I do buy a new PC with digital for monitors, this monitor is already able to switch.  The clarity is remarkable; I am using 1280 x 1024 resolution that fits this screen perfectly.  I can't add anymore to what other reviewers have already said about it stats.

As far as quality and service and price from Amazon.com, I give them 5 stars.  I have no complaints. I would recommend this monitor to anyone looking for quality

Whether you have a VIAO notebook, or a SONY plasma TV or a flat panel, or even a CRT, SONY offers one of the most striking and crystal clear images in this world. It'll cost you a lot more than brands like ACER, VIEWSONIC, or DELL, but mind you, SONY has been making TV's for a lot longer than any of these companies, so their technologies carry over to all of their displays.
can't go wrong with this Japanese marvel of a company

After reading tons of info, checking critics' recommendations and comparing monitors online, I went to check them out at a CompUSA store.  After seeing some of the monitors and brands the critics like, many of the monitors appeared similar with only vague differences.  Except this Sony.  It outshined all others by a wide margin.  There are two Sony models that have the same frame, so be sure you look at the one with the "XBrite" technology because it's very different.  I have never needed the height adjustment and wires are totally unobtrusive.  This was a plug and play unit, no adjustments were necessary (I changed the pre-sets, but went right back).  So far, after about a month living with this monitor I can't say too many good things about it

Just wanted to note that the contract is available at the top of this page. If you buy this service plan, print out the contract and keep your receipt. I have no idea how true they are to their contract, but I read the service plan intensely since I nearly got it.

Some notes on the contract:
1. It is only good in the United States (including Washington, DC, but MINUS MAINE), but it does not include Guam, Virgin Islands, etc. So if you are in another country or outside the 50 states + D.C., this contract will be nothing but a waste of money.
2. This contract is transferable and the directions to do so are simple.
3. They will only fix/replace/etc IF the manufacturing warranty no longer covers the item. That is, if the manu. warranty is still good, you have to use it.
4. If the item needs to be shipped, shipping/handling will only be covered if the manufacturer would cover those costs in their warranty period. If the item is being replaced, "You will be responsible for the delivery or cost of delivery of the covered Product to Our authorized service center. Reimbursement will be issued in the form of a check payable to You." I'm uncertain if that means you cover those costs or they reimburse you.
5. No lemon policy of 3 service repairs for the SAME defect, and a upon the time of a 4th repair, as determined by them, they will "replace it with a product of comparable performance. Repairs performed while the Product is under manufacturer's warranty DO NOT APPLY." (Doesn't sound like a great no lemon policy... your product would have to breakdown in the same way 4 times in the number of years they cover you -- many electronics are covered by the manufacturer for 1 year.)
6. There are numerous conditions that they will not repair for, but they all sound typical of such plans (such as, they don't cover accidents and they don't cover "the elements or acts of God" ... sorry, I had to note that second one since it stuck out to me from the other things). But, in all seriousness, read the list before you purchase.

So, now that I have summarized much of the contract, if you want to get the service warranty, PLEASE READ THE CONTRACT SINCE I DIDN'T COVER EVERYTHING!!! (Don't hold me liable since I don't have much money anyways.) Also, I think this is typical in warranty contracts, but you will occassionally see the phrase "at our discretion" in the contract.

Assuming they aren't jerks with their discretion and aren't too tough to deal with, I would give the warranty 4 stars (minus 1 star for the crappy lemon policy). I didn't get the coverage because the product I was going to get it for had just made into the next price category (so it was pricy for my product, being at the lower price end of the scale)

I bought this thinking "Failures due to normal wear and tear", which is checked on the checklist of items covered on the overview page, would include accidental damage such as dropping.  However the pdf indicates that (3) DAMAGE FROM ACCIDENT, ABUSE, MISUSE, INTRODUCTION OF FOREIGN OBJECTS INTO THE PRODUCT," is not covered.  This is just an extended manufacturer's warranty.  A call to customer service confirms this - damage due to accidents are not covered.  Save your money

I have had three of these units for the past 5-6 years (one for my PC, one for the wife's and one for the Tivo & cable box).  We have relatively unreliable power here with it going off an average of once a month -- usually for seconds at a time but occasionally for hours.  Anyway these units have kept our stuff safe and running.  However they don't last too long on battery power.  Just long enough for short power outages or long enough to shut things down.

The batteries wore out after about 2-3 years so I replaced them using batteries from a web vendor.  Now the first battery of this second round has failed so I'm buying another round of three batteries.  

Hopefully these units will last many more years.

Had mine since December 1999 but noticed that the battery failed after about 3 years, like the other poster wrote, APC didn't list a replacement at first but now they do and I finally got around to replacing it.  Battery type is RBC2 for those wondering.

Solid unit, having a telephone line/out and USB controller is a plus.

This unit is my 2ed UPS made by APC.  I out grew the other and decided on this unit. The USB connection is what sold me on this as I leave my computer on most of the day.  It did shut down (using the included software) during a test I ran and the software as gives you a battery charge state.  A must have if you are in an area that has frequent power problems.  With the built in surge protection, you can't go wrong

This is a great little disposable armband. I say disposable because its so cheap you can toss it if you want and get a new one.  Nice adjustable band, although I can see this wearing out in the future as the band loses elasticity.  Great for the gym.  It even comes with a little custom fit LCD screen protector which is a nice touch.  The arm band is removable, so even if you are just looking for a skin...this is a stea

This thing was slipping and sliding all over the place and I constantly had to readjust in so the functions were in place.  The slot on the top that is supposed to allow you to use the "hold" feature is completely off so you end up having to stretch the thing over to turn it on and off.  The little plastic protector that covers the screen would not stay in place over the screen and I was constantly losing it between the silicon cover and the ipod.  I finally just gave up on it and returned it.  I bought it because it is one of the only ipod accessories that has a fair price tag.  I think I'll just get it over with and buy one of the more expensive options.  Was this thing even meant for the Gen 2 nano

I LOVE this arm band. I have had it for about 6 months now. You dont have to take your iPOD out of the arm band to charge it or to hook it up to your computer. I also only use my iPOD for the gym, so its nice that this arm band provides great protection (better than iPOD's armbands because it fits snugly and wont scratch it when you put it on) as well as not coming off while working out.

There's not really a lot to say about this product - it protects your nano, the material is good quality, it is not too thick (doesn't bulk up the nano too much) and not too thin (provides enough protection).

I wanted this to go jogging with my ipod - it fills that function perfectly, the strap is comfortable.

The only flaw that I have found (this does not bother me, but I know it might bother others - hence 4 instead of 5 stars), the material does act as a bit of a dust collector - if you put it in a dusty packet, it will collect a lot of dust.

This armband was certainly the right price.  I use it everytime I work out at the health club.  I never have to remove it to charge the nano.  My only negative comment is that dust sticks to the screen cover and cannot be cleaned off due to the compsition of the screen cover material.

This is definitely a great investment.  I can take as many pictures as I want to and not have to worry that the stick is getting full.  I have two sons who also like to take pictures and in the past I would have to take my pictures off the stick so they could use it to take their pictures because the stick we were using had less memory and got full really fast.  Now I can leave my pictures on the memory stick as long as I want to, until I'm ready to download them or delete them. Everyone should start off with a 1GB memory stick because it's convenient and really worth the money spent

I mean seriously guys, is it really worth forking over to those greedy peeps at Sony over 40 dollars just for a silly memory card. There is an easier way to do it ya know. For your psp, if the game is really important to you and you can't save it. Just press up on the power switch real quick the screen will go off..it will go on hold and next time you wanna play it again.. just push it back up..and hopefully if you did it right you'll have the game right back in the place you left it..hey it saved me 50 dollars..and it can do the same thing for yo

I have no complaints about Amazon on this item, but I do with Sony, because their Memory Stick is not "regular" sized.  It does not fit into my HP memory stick slot, so I have to use a cable connection with my Sony Camera.  My previous digital had a standard size memory stick that slid right into my computer.  I gave that camera to my son, who loves that feature also for his computer.  It's strange to me that Sony would choose not to be a standard size in this memory stick business.  It just does not make sense to me.

I've been using this card with my Canon S400 for the past 9 months and am very pleased with it.  However, about a month ago, I noticed that the write speed increased from about a second to three-four seconds per image.  It's kind of annoying since it was so quick before, but other than that, the card has served me well

Your rebate submission has been received.
Unfortunately your rebate is denied for the following reasons:
REQUEST POSTMARKED AFTER CLOSE OF PROGRAM DEADLINE
REQUIRED POSTMARK BEFORE 09/10/04; ACTUAL POSTMARK 09/13/04
***********************************************

There was absolutely no cut-off submission deadline given, except the purchase by date and submit within a certain time after receiving purchase.
All were followed to the "T".

I submitted the rebate immediately after I received the merchandise from Amazon.

Give me a break, I'll never touch another thing from viking except with a 10' pole.

If it was not so piddling an amount, this would be worth reporting to FCC, but the state of customer protection in this country make you jump through even more hoops, probably for nothing, more heartache.
Just forego rebates, send Viking back to the boat and purchase another brand

I bought this card for my digital camera and I have had it for a while now.  I have not had any problems with it, it was fairly cheap, and the speed seems to be fine.  I reccomend it for anything except recording full 640x480 video at 30 FPS, because since this isn't a high speed card, when I tried to record at that quality and resolution, I only got about 15 or 20 seconds of movie recording time before the card got too slow.  Other than that, I like this card and reccomend i

I bought the 128MB card 8-9 mnths ago. At first didnt notice it but the usable memory kept getting smaller! Finally it gave a 'Error Reading Card'  message and stopped working. Customer service at Viking was very very helpful and prompt. They replaced the card is 7 days. They also tried to retrieve some of the images that I had considered 'lost' in the card and sent me a CD with the images on it! I was impressed with the excellent support, but not too impressed that the card died so early in its life. Would I buy it again? Yes but likely go for keeping a backup card on hand at all times as well

I've been using this system for a couple of months now and couldn't be happier with it. I bought it for my office so I could listen to my classical CDs while I was working on my website and writing book reviews. Plus, even though it only has a short external antenna, I can get the NPR classical music station on FM which is over a hundred miles away.

It's small enough to fit on my bookshelf and has great sound for the size of its speakers. Of course, it doesn't compare to my big stereo in the living room with its 4' high tower speakers, but who cares. It delivers most of the sound I need in a small space for background music.

All in all, well worth the money so far. Highly recommended at this point

It has become nearly impossible to find a compact stereo of any quality with a cassette deck and an Aux input. I mean what is with the marketing hype these days of "MP3 and iPod compatible!" All you need is an aux line input for pete's sake. My old JVC purchased nearly 20 years ago had aux in and with the help of easily found adaptor still plays all my iPods just fine. But, the belt drive on the tape deck failed twice and repairing it is no longer an option. So, we bought this... and it works, but the build quality is less than stellar, the sound is simply ok, and the remote works provided you have a clear line of sight to the unit. But all that, given the price, i think it's a good deal. Hope this helps

Out of the carton -- everything worked as advertized, and the sound is pleasant. The speakers are the weak link. The day after I set it up to test it, I replaced the speakers with an inexpensive pair of Radioshack speakers I bought years ago: model 7s, I believe -- 4" woofer, 1/2" tweeter in a small, solid sealed enclosure of walnut veneer. These speakers are half the size of the supplied SONYs, and at least twice the weight.

The improvement in sound was astounding. It transformed this package, which has a robust amp, into something worth listening to for hours on end. It reproduced a wide range of music, from a Beethoven string quartet, to Louis Armstrong doing Fats Waller, to Renee' Fleming doing "Marietta's Lied" with full orchestra -- all with surprising authority. My only concern with the main unit is that the latch on the CD lid on top of the unit may one day wear out, preventing the lid from closing. The cassette player worked without any problems. I have yet to learn how to set the timer for the unit to turn on, but the instruction book is clear, and the remote is handy and easy to use.

I wonder how my main system, with Axiom Ti3s and a Klipsh subwoofer, would sound off this modest box from SONY -- or the old Jensen Tri-ettes I use in my 'study' system. Put a classic pair of JBL Lancers on this unit, and I don't think you would be the least bit dissappointed.

As I said, out of the carton the system works fine, and the sound is pleasant enough, but be aware that the electronics in the box are waiting to bloom. If you have an old pair of moderately efficient speakers in the basement or attic, dust them off, hook them up, and enjoy.

Not a bad little unit...  wish it remembered where you were on the CD when you turn it off like other units I'm used to especially since it doesn't really "shut off" but goes into "stand-by" mode...  Not as much power as I thought it would have for 30 watts...   Would be nice if the aux (ipod/mp3) jack was on the front not the back...  speaker 2 output would be nice...  simple little unit, works fine so far..

I was trying to find a small unit for the bedroom to replace a previous unit. The NEZ30 model (30 watts, not the NEZ3) fits the bill. The sound is incredible and loud for a small unit. It sounds better than the bigger unit I had. The design of the speakers with the special bass produces a very rich and round sound. And that's without the DSG activated. The bass and treble can be adjusted (-3 to +3) but only with the remote. If you buy a unit used be sure it has the remote. Also I needed something with a tape player like another reviewer

For sub-$100, this little stereo does everything I need it to. This "micro" unit is truly small: it fits on top of our microwave, speakers and all. The CMT-NEZ30 replaced a boombox that conked out. To replace it, I wanted something through which I could play my MP3 player. That function works well. It is an simple auxiliary input, and allows me to play my podcasts at home without walking around with headphones on. 

At 30 watts, the sound is ample for the kitchen, and significantly more powerful than what I had previously. I didn't want something so powerful that needed to be played loudly in order to get full sound. That is not to say it can't put out some volume, however. As for sound quality, it is the very crisp, balanced sound that Sony fans have come to expect. For the wide range of music I play, the bass and treble settings cover it all. 

The single-CD player may discourage some people, but since it can play MP3 CDs, you can get some serious playtime out of it. For myself, my cooking is rarely so complicated that I can't stop to change a CD, anyhow. 

But I saved the best thing for last: it has a cassette player! (Insert cricket chirps here.) 

All in all, I am very happy with this unit for its versatility, size, and sound quality. It was the perfect solution for my needs

If you're looking for bells and whistles look elsewhere. If you're looking for 3 or 5 disc changer, not this one. If you need a nice little stereo to play one CD at a time, space saving, full and clean tone - this is awesome !!! It looks really sharp, has a crisp sound. Perfect for a small bedroom or office. I am very happy with this purchase. Has a tape deck as well and radio. EQ settings are simple - no presets, just bass and treble - there is also DSGX switch [kind of like a loudness setting] just leave it ON. Very simple, well made - I like it !! No frills, great price

I purchased two ten packs of Lenmar batteries.  Of the twenty batteries, only 4 would take a charge.  I used 3 different chargers, an Energizer, LaCrosse, and a RipVan100.  The LaCrosse is a high-end charger with diagnostics (can display voltage levels, etc., individually for each battery, it can also 'repair' batteries maximum capacities, etc. - so can the RipVan100)...  None could charge the 16 faulty batteries.  I sent both 10 packs back

I bought this to read my Smartmedia cards and it worked very well. As an added bonus it is also a nice looking product. It is sky blue and has a clear USB cord - sort of Reminds me of an IMac. Good little inexpensive card reader Note: I did't use it for any card type other than Smartmedia

This system is not the most sophisticated or powerful you can buy, but it represents a great value for the money.  I've had no trouble operating it after a reasonably quick and simple installation.

A great feature is the multi-disk changer.  After you've tried it you will wonder how you did without it.  The ability to move from disk to disk without having to re-insert them is a huge conveinience factor.

Highly recommended

I have this in the bedroom connected to a 13" TV (it plays DVDs as well as CDs).  The sound is great and it has a classy understated look.  I am thinking of buying one for my office and once for the garage.

First of all, let me say that I LOVE this stereo.  Have had it for a year or two.  I don't think you can do any better with this price range, and more. I highly recommend it. 

I have a question - does anyone know whether this stereo plays dvd's of all regions?  I tried to write JVC an email but didn't get any response.  

Hopefully somebody has the answer!

Thanks

When I saw this component stereo system in a "Good Guys" store I was immediately impressed with the overall look of the thing. As I started toying with the floor model, I realized how versatile it was, and decided that it was something I wanted to own. Sadly, the floor model was the only unit left in the store, and there wouldn't be anymore coming since "Good Guys" was going out of business. That was not acceptable to me. So, I went elsewhere to find the same system.

When I found the item on-line, for a much better price, I was sold. 
Getting it only took a few days, and it was delivered right to my place of work, for my convienence. 

What impressed me the most about the unit was the sheer depth of sound it produced. When playing a movie with grand scenes and lots of special effects, the little system did not disappoint in giving a theatrical experience in sound.

Other features were also pretty cool to me, such as the LCD light. While it gave off a nice blue glow, it could be dimmed, which was a nice touch. 

All in all, with all the features this device has, I am certain I will have many years of enjoyment. It is a great system for the right price and truly impressive

I needed a small system for my office.  I wanted removable speakers, good sound at all volumes and a sleek look.  This system filled that void.  I searched for about a month to get it, and there is nothing less than fantastic about this system, even the price.

In terms of sound, I can understand music at all volume levels (many cheaper systems distort at low levels) and at high volumes it sounds great.  I can't use it at high volumes now that I've taken it to work, but I am thinking about buying another for my living room at home (run the output of my family room stereo and I'll have a system that sounds good in both places for parties).

In terms of looks, this system is very cool.  I tried to downplay it by placing it behind my desk, on the shelf where I keep my food, so that people wouldn't question it (because small stereos are allowed but not everyone likes us having them).  Despite my attempts to blend it in, I've received several complements on the way that it looks.  Silver casing and a sleek design are just the basics, this system features a blue backlit display that looks great!

I thought that the "DVD" option in the stereo meant that you could play MP3s on DVD (a great idea for someone who wants to never have to change CDs), but in fact it meant that the system is a DVD player, and it has a video output to connect to your tv.  That's a nice plus.  I haven't tried the MP3 idea yet, so it may or may not support them.

The stock antenna is terrible, but so are most stereo antennas.  I'll buy a new one soon...  The other downside is that you can't switch between presets without the remote (you can change the station, but not using presets).  But with 30 FM presets, I'll never run out!  The only thing that wasn't obvious about the set-up is that the disk buttons (disk 1, disk 2, etc) on the stereo are the eject buttons, not the select buttons like most other stereos.  Overall, this is a great design for a great stereo.  I used to work at a radio station as the engineer and now I wish I had this back then because I could blast music in my office and really utilize the system the way it was meant to..

This is my second disappointment with Linksys products.
I have purchased this AP to use in AP client mode connected to my Netgear WGR614 wireless router. The product comes with no user manual or technical specifications sheet. After spending some time trying to set up connection I  have found user manual on Linksys web site, and discovered that AP client (as well as AP repeater) modes are supported only with another Linksys Access Point. It's not compatible with other vendor's products.
When I tried to use it in Access Point mode, the signal was 2-3 times weaker then my old Netgear's. 
I am getting Very Good to Excellent signal quality from Netgear WGR614 (36-54 Mbps) and Good to Very Good (11 to 24 Mbps) from WAP54G..

The minor problem is that the user manual claims the user ID is "admin". Well, it is not. Frustration and wasted time will occur until you somehow find out that the user ID should be left blank to log in.

The major problem is that the unit only works for twelve to 36 hours before it has be rebooted. After twelve to 36 hours it looses the connection to the wireless network. Once you unplug and plug back the power cord, it will work fine for another twelve to 36 hours. I am used to rebooting Windows every time it hangs, but I don't accept having a Wireless Access Point that hangs (I am not sure how Microsoft was able to convince me it is OK for an OS to hang). This box is going back. I already bought a Buffalo that works fine

We bought this AP to use with WPA Enterprise using a radius server and basically, it dosen't work. At first we couldn't get it to communicate with our radius server at all. We resolved this by changing wireless channels until one worked. Then authentication worked, but we couldn't get an address via DHCP. We couldn't resolve this so we assigned a static address, but couldn't pass any traffic over the link. Unfortunately, we found the Linksys support to be friendly but ultimately useless. There only suggestion was to try different firmware. Once we had done this, they couldn't help any more. So basically, they might say it works, but it doesn't. Tried a different manufacturers AP, worked straight away.

I'll admit after reading some of these reviews I was a little weary of purchasing this unit, but I got it for $32, so couldn't pass it up.  I was replacing a LinkSys BEFW11S4 (wireless B).  

In a nutshell, I followed the instructions to connect the hardware, popped the CD in my "hard wired" desktop PC, took a couple of minutes to step through the setup screens (which are totally simple to navigate), enabling WEP along the way.  When I was done, I fired up my laptop (which has built in wireless-G card).  Network was detected immediately... all I had to do was type in the WEP key (which was generated from my passphrase entered during the setup) and viola!  Connected at 54 Mbps!!
Awesome.  The setup procedure could NOT have been any easier.  I would recommend this device to anyone that already has a cable/dsl router (with a free port) and simply wants to add (or upgrade) wireless-G connectivity in their home.

This thing is JUNK!!!  Don't waste your money.  I am a computer professional and I had it working for about 5 minutes, then after powering it down and back up it never did work again!  If you buy one, go through the setup and if it doesn't work immediately SEND IT RIGHT BACK TO AMAZON!  Don't waste your precious time trying to get a $70 brick to do wireless because the odds are that you will just be wasting your time.

Finally, Amazon likes to keep the good reviews toward the top of the list to keep the potential customer from being discouraged. However, YOU SHOULD PAY MORE ATTENTION TO THE BAD REVIEWS THAN THE GOOD ONES. If the product is in fact good it won't have many bad reviews, or even possibly none at all if it is exceptional. However, look up all the bad reviews for this product. They should tell you that something is seriously wrong with this product

Which turned out to be a problem for me since thats not what I wanted (I was looking for a compact flash card reader for the older compact flash cards, and just assumed that SD and CF were the same.)  Luckily I also has some TransFlash cards that I am using it with and it works great.  I especially like the small design with no cords like a lot of other flash readers have

This tiny piece of plastic with metal contacts packs more whallop than you could imagine.  Sure, memory geeks like me may find little things like this more awe-inspiring than the next...but practically speaking it is good for more than just the techno geek.  What this large amount of memory provides is a way to store tons of pictures, movies, ringtones, etc. over a long period of time...and then you can "dump" it onto your computer.  The other thing you can do with it is store a lot of music to play on your phone..

I bought this card reader to use with my SD memory cards from my digital camera and Palm Tungsten E2. Transferring pictures and music via the cables supplied with the camera and Palm is a bit slow and who needs more cables?  This little device allows me to add, delete, copy and paste files using My Computer.  It takes up virtually no room, and I use it between both my desktop and laptop computers.  There was no installation issues - I have Windows XP on both machines and it recognized and installed the card reader immediately, without any interference from me. Last but not least, the price can't be beat

I purchased the 2GB Elite Pro SD card but found out that my older SimpleTech FlashLink card reader is not able to recognize the card under WinXP SP2 with and without the most recent SimpleTech drivers. I don't have another card reader for my computer, but the pictures recorded on it by my digital camera can be viewed on my PDA so I assume that it's the card reader. Shortly afterwards, I also discovered that Kingston makes a combo kit that includes their USB 2.0 SD/MMC reader for a bit less in price than the card alone.

I also noticed the ATP line of 60x and 150x SD cards. I have no experience with their products, but their SD cards are potted versus placed in a plastic shell. They tout their cards as being more rugged and waterproof. I'm very careful and have not had any flash cards fail on me, but with the rising capacities and smaller form factors, I will consider the ATP cards in the future.

I bought this memory card for my camera sd500.  At first, I was very dispointed when I only see 1gb on my laptop.  After googled around, I realized I need to update my laptop sd reader driver to recognized sd card that is over 1gb.  I'm able to see full 2gb after driver update.  Just make sure you update your device/laptop firmware/driver first

Hi,
I'm a TomTom addict.  I've been addicted ever since I first plugged in my TomTom 300 and found a new way to work.  Ever since, I've relied on my tomtom to get me from point A to point B.
The user interface is easy to use, intuitive and clever and allows me to find nearby restaurants, hotels or even train stations nearby.
My tomtom is so great, I've even let friends borrow it at work when they have a meeting with a client they have never been to before.
There are some problems: anytime I find my way somewhere using my TomTom, I can't find my way home without the Tomtom.  That's why I'm addicted.
It's reduced my frustration in the car and made me really happy.
Thanks TOMTOM.
Your friend,
NEver Lost Dre

I used it around my city and even took it to Hawaii and it was a lot of help. People forget that the idea of the GPS is to help you find where you are, where you want to go and how to get there but like everything else, it may not be 100% correct -what really is?

What I didn't like about it was the windshield mount broke so it no longer sticks on the windshield.

The biggest thing is that the maps are out-dated. I live in an area where they are building a lot of new homes. Even developments that are 2 years old aren't on the map!

I don't mind paying for updates - I realize that someone has to get paid to update the maps - but I will not pay several hundred dollars to buy a whole new set of maps

If TomTom's maps fail and you submit a bug report, the nice support site sends you to TeleAtlas's site which promptly CLOSES the support request.  It took two requests before I realized I was being redirected away from TomTom's site.

The real problem is not with the maps (which is a good thing), but with the mapping engine (determine how to find a point on a map).  I submit the request to the main support group only to have those bozos close the request saying that the problem is with the map.  At this point I don't care who is wrong since neither TomTom nor TeleAtlas will say who owns the mapping engine.  This stupid device failed when I needed it the most, driving in New Jersey! The TomTom Go 300 cannot map roads that are broken, see bug submission below for more information.

So, why two stars?
- It fails when you need it
- I could scroll around the working map and find the right street, but then I need to stop in an unsafe state .. er .. I mean place and use the device like it was my trusty AAA map.
- Support does not read bug reports (I want that job with zero accountability please!)

Does it work? Yes it does and it does work very well when you have a nice clean streets with a good map.  It does take some time to find its GPS often, but its tolerable. It manages to lose signal with tree cover (seriously, I can still see the sky).

Moral of this review: verify with an online map service BEFORE driving to unknown places.  Defeats the prupose? No.  TomTom Go 300 did find my way around some detours in NJ near Trenton and get me into the parking garage saving me time and frustration (the prupose of this device).

Updates:
After using TomTom Go 300 for a few months I have seen more problems than I care for.  I have recommended everyone in my family to not buy TomTom products.  The map for my area, King of Prussia, PA more than two years out of date.  It got my dad lost going to a hotel which is 1.3 miles away from me.

In some areas, you will fall off the map.  The most annoying new feature is TomTom alterate route functions.  I am headed to a fork in a road in the middle of nowhere.  TomTom wants me to take the "long" way to my destination by switching from the State Route (meaning Route 1 or Route 66) that I'm on to the another State Route at the fork.  The thing is, if I tell it not to take the other State Route, the damn device will tell me to turn around!!  Once I pass the fork it keeps telling me to turn around.  When I choose to re-run the routing software from where I am, it figures out a new route completely passing the road that I need to take.  The road is on the TomTom map, but it won't take it until I get on to it.  WHAT GIVES?

Bug Report submitted to TomTom
-------
TomTom Go 300 v6.150
The mapping engine is BROKEN.  It cannot handle a road that is broken into several non-contiguous sections.  The city, Pennsauken, gave several distinct streets the SAME name!

Destination:
3401 Cooper Ave, Pennsauken, NJ 08109


If you map the destination on any Internet site and scroll around, you would see that:

[...]
All points map to real locations but are not on the same physical road.  They are on different roads by the same name in the same city.

The TomTomGo 300's map actually has these locations on it, but is UNABLE to map to anything but the first OCCURANCE of Cooper Ave: 7200 Cooper Ave, Pennsauken, NJ 08109

Trying to find the intersection (cross street) of two streets Cooper Ave and Park Ave does not work even though the TomTom's map clearly shows that they do intersect.  TomTom can only see the intersection of Cooper Ave and Derousse Ave.

That area has several other streets, Sherman Ave for example, that are also non-contiguous

Received the TOMTOM 300 before date promised in perfect condition even though the box was dented. ( Good packing! )

I have used the TOMTOM to go from NYC to Monticello, NY and from Atlantic City, New Jersey to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and home to NYC again. The TOMTOM performed flawlessly in Philly guiding me to the sites I wanted to visit and back to my hotel. I also tested it on routes I knew to see how it would route me if I deviated and it came through with flying colors.

The only shortcoming is that the display is difficult to read in bright sunshine. The on-board voice makes up for that letting you know when a turn is coming up. I have a co-worker who has used this device for two years and is very satisfied. I bought it on his recommendation and do not have any regrets

I bought the original Tom Tom Go back in November 2004.  Since then, my attempts to reach their customer service have all met in failure.  My last attempt, 10 days ago, was an effort to buy updated maps for my product.  Yes, their website will offer to sell you maps, but there is no way to determine the date of the maps you already own, and no way to determine the date of the maps that you would be purchasing, in some cases for a large sum of money.  If you try to find a telephone number on their site that you can call, you will be disappointed.  I am disappointed and would advise you to look elsewhere if you want a product that is supported

I've been driving a Logitech Momo (black) for about 3 years, and loved it. Until now.

This new wheel, pedal, and gearshift set is, in a word, awesome.

With 900 degree wheel rotation, stronger force feedback, a clutch, and gated shifting the level of realism is unbelievable.

Did you ever want to go racing, but couldn't afford the time or cost? With this set and Live For Speed, GTR2, rFactor or (one of these days?) iRacing's as yet unreleased programs you can. And after some practice "in the privacy of your own home," you can go online and race LIVE with folks all over the world. You heart WILL pound and you WILL sweat!

Okay, maybe I'm weird, but at 60+ I still manage to find time to race 10-15 hours a week! And there are no long, tiring drives to the race track, no hotel and food expenses, no long waits for the other classes to get off the track, and no long drive home with a wrecked car on the trailer behind you. An hour behind the wheel is an hour racing.

I have a heart valve problem and there are times I wonder if this is really safe after all

I've had a few wheels before, but finally Logitech came out with a wheel thats simulation grade.  The 6 speed shifter works great, and as for the clutch, I've found that there are plenty of games that support it, including GTR2 and Need for Speed Carbon thats just coming out.  Besides the lengthy setup and steep price, this is a great wheel for a great racing experience

First the good.
The feedback is strong and prescise. Very smooth steering and it will immerse you into the game. NFS Most Wanted and GTR 2 are great with this wheel. The shifter is awesome, although you do not want to beat it up. A ginger approach makes it work best. The pedals are very solid with good tension, although you have to have very small feet if you are going to use all three. I use my clutch for the brake forgetting the middle pedal.
Now for the bad.
The clamping system works, but for how long? Plastic screws are only going to last so long, and you have to really tighten them for the wheel to stay put. There are mounting nuts on the bottom, but are you going to drill 2 holes through your desk? Microsoft has a superior clamp in my opinion. The shifter works well, and I am sure it will last with care. Be nice to it though. The pedals are to close together. Other than that, they are perfect.
Overall, I highly recommend this wheel. For the money you can't get a better wheel

Supposedly someone listened at the Logi office of the NASCAR MOMO discontinuation for a cheeze model of nearly equal price.  That does not excuse this exorbiance.  The clutch pedal is not implimented in games and until it is you are paying for a dead hand(or foot).  This wheel and the transmission (hump) style gearshift is quite cool and gee whiz is the first re-action, the console buttons are only useful, again if the game doesn't back out of it.  Hard Truck series backs out of any digit button or other past # 10 with in a few minutes play time as it is not designed that way and can cause software corruptions. One would usually need this for race car games, but it can be used in other driver games making it more diverse and no need to buy a separate unit for compatiblity probs.  However. in as and most games do not even use more than six or eight buttons or macros at a time, the extra buttons are redundant gimiks.  The styl'n Corvette style trans-hump shifter with the console buttons is nice to look at (stick a virtual transmission hump of carpeted cardboard on the ground under it for realistic effect) and the gear can shift better than a rudder(better used as a turn signal) other than that, either go down on price or give us key-to-button config in games that do not support it.  Heel-toe shift is simply a way of saying shift with the clutch, how lameo is that

Considering the Logitech website states that this product isn't available until Oct.31st, I don't know why people are ancy.  Mine came 3 weeks ahead of Amazon's estimate.

ANYWAY...  Phenomenal build quality, largest diameter wheel available, and sturdy pedal base are among the highlights.  The shifter unit feels flimsy, but as long as you don't overdo it, it should last.  Its still just cool enough that they were able to pack in a gated shifter with a sequential option.  I've played rFactor, GTR2 and Richard Burns Rally with the wheel and the feedback is awesome.  GTR2 probably does it the best.  If you're ready to step up from consumer wheels, and you can't afford the prosumer BRD and ECCI stuff, I don't think you'd be disappointed with this

I placed my order on October 5th and for several days now it says 'the item is shipping soon' which normally means it's being packaged but it hasn't actually been shipped.  I haven't called Amazon yet but might do so today to find out what's going on.  I want this wheel so bad

Received notice last week that it was in the shipping stage.  It still is.

Shows in-stock, but it's not actually shipping (thought he page says it is).

Contacted Amazon, and they say it's shipping on the 15th, but the page still says in-stock and available for shipping.

I have no idea what's going on here...  They were not at all clear.  Did they over-book

First of all, let my point out that mine came with demos of crimson skies and mech assault and the full version of xbox classic arcade.  Mine was new in the certified microsoft box, etc.  Maybe they just updated the games.

Anyways, it is in my opinion a better deal to buy the 12-month pack, but I decided on the 3-month just because I've got the 2-month trial already and didn't want 14 months built up.

In the box:  There's the communicator headset, a 3-month subscription card, the game discs, and several manuals on connecting to xbox live.

The communicator:  Purely awesome.  I have read many people's comments saying that it breaks at the little clip.  I grant it that the clip is thin and could potentially break easily, but it is not uber fragile.  Don't be afraid to put it on.  The headset weighs next to nothing and is really comfortable.  It has great outgoing voice quality and great sound quality through the speaker.

Xbox Live Itself:  Do you have broadband?  Do you have a router and a switch or hub if needed?  If the answers are both yes, you need xbox live.  It is incredible.

Buy this or the 12-month kit if you are just starting (but don't forget to start your account first with the free 2 months.  After you have live already, renew with the subscription card

I recently installed this unit into my 1995 Geo Prizm after the factory stereo lost its FM capabilities.  Installation was a snap with the purchase of an adapter plate and power wire adapter.  I left the speakers from the previous radio in the car...Boston Acoustics 5 1/4" in the front and JBL 6 1/2" in the rear.  AM stations sound like the factory's FM and the FM is so clear that I hear instruments in the music that I didn't hear before.  I must say that the Dual unit lacks a low end unless you turn on the "loudness," and then it is adequate.  A large part of the problem is the JBL's in the back.  I do not believe they are capable of cranking out bass.  The stations pull in great on both bands and there are plenty of pre-select stations to program (6 AM and 18 FM)...I don't know what the local/distant feature does in this unit.  It doesn't seem to have an effect.  The CD player is very good...very clear and hasn't skipped when I am gone down bumpy roads and potholes.

There are claims of the brightness of the radio when driving at night...well yes, there is no question about the brightness.  It's a nice blue and it doesn't bother me a bit...as a matter of fact, it is easy to use the radio in the dark because the controls are easily seem and identified.  A weird "feature" about this radio is that when you have it turned off, any button will turn it on...any button!

All-in-all, bang-for-buck, this Dual XDM6820 is worth every penny that I spent on it.  I didn't want to spend a whole lot of money for a radio in this old vehicle, but I really got my money's worth and more with this purchase

I liked the unit. it is very well built, materials and workmanship are close to perfect, sound quality is also very good. at least more than enough for a car.

Mp3 player is quite fast - it takes 2-3 seconds to recognize the disk.
"Random play" is not really random - the sequence is always the same and very predictable.

Controls are convinient, radio reception is also very good. 

The only issue which is VERY annoing - blue leds highhlighing push-buttons are EXTREMELY bright. there is no way to dim them or swith off. it's hard to drive at the night time with the unit on. I had to make a small black paper cover for it to get rid of this bright light:

I was purchased this item for Indian car. The installation is very simple, if you have a knowledge of installing such products then it is much more easier.
It plays all song formats without skipping... 
AM/FM is also good. Tuner is very good. It tunes all stations.

Bad: Regarding Time display. There is not time display in this item. If you want to see current time , you need ot click on DISP button

Can't ask for more, clear sound, nicely finished, easy to use and the best part is the iPlug just plug it and you are done, your ipod doesn't get power from the 12v oultlet of the car (better for ipod's helth) no interferience like FM modulators. It doesn't get any better for the price

I too was looking for an iPod connection for my '99 9-3 Saab that was w/o original radio/cd. I couldn't believe the price on this unit but the reviews convinced me, anyway it was fairly easy to install, took me an hour from start to finish. All I needed were 12 solderless connectors and a wire stripper/crimping tool. I've been using the unit for a week now and will agree with some reviews who say the lights are too bright. Great for daytime, way too much for night. I've considered a couple options, one was dark window tint overlays but I've decided to alter the removable faceplate provided with the unit to fashion a cover. I'll slice the FP cover in half at the hinge giving me two covers, some velcro and I'll have a cover that will work at night, set the unit how i like and place the FP cover over it using the velcro to secure. Should be a breeze to do.

I owned a $350 Eclipse CD player and the Dual doesn't sound quite as good but the feature set, price and iPod connector make up for the slight difference in sound quality. The skip protection in the Dual seems better than the Eclipse.

All and all a great buy. I'm very happy with the Dual

 After reading reviews on this and other products, I decided to go with the Dual XDM-6820. I got it from Amazon for $79 and free shipping. I've been using it now for about a month and have not been disappointed by anything! (I was already expecting the ridiculously bright lights from the other reviews) This stereo has so far been one of those purchases that keeps surprising me with it's versatility and features. I've found that a quick perusal of the instructions was enough to be able to use almost all the important functions: CD playback, radio station presets, radio scan, eq customization, switching between albums on a single MP3 disc, mute, external audio source plugin jack (i.e. iPod or even a Walkman), etc.

The sound tends to be a little on the high and crisp end, and I have to turn the bass eq. up to 5 (out of I think 8) to get a decent frequency range. But it's not bad enough to take away from the overall value of this gem.

Overall I can't understand why this stereo was so cheap! It's way better than a Pioneer model I bought a number of years back. The 50x4watts have my little Chevy thumping and I love the MP3 features of being able to pop 8 albums on a single disc and quickly switch between them. This model is a gem, and I would strongly recommend it to anyone who wants a car MP3/CD player, but who wants to spend less than $100. Buy it

I have to agree with other posters here who praise the sound, but can't stand the bright blue lights.  

Performance:  GREAT! It made the stock speakers in my ten year old Corolla sound absolutely amazing.  Much better than the much more expensive Pioneer I installed in another vehicle a couple of years ago.  Likewise the controls on the Dual are straightforward and easy to use.  With the Pioneer, I had to get the manual out whenever I wanted to do something as simple as setting the clock.

No way to dim those damn blue lights, though.  They are so bright that you can't see the AC/HEAT control illumination at night.  I tried the trick of taking off the buttons, but couldn't get them out, so I guess I'm stuck with that.

Installation was easy.  With the correct harness and knowing your speaker config, it took about 1 hour.  BTW, I have never install a car stereo before.  

It has all the features you can think of from a mp3 player.  Many small details, like able to save preset volume and prefered EQ and seperate them in FM mode or CD mode.  I am really impressed.  Build in 200 Watts AMP creates a solid and deep sound with my factory speakers.  Of course, with a speaker upgrade and preamp it will sound alot better, but this is really pretty good with no other modifications.

The i-plug is a blessing.  Ever tried to play your MP3s with a FM modulator or tape adaptor?  They gernerally sound really distorted and at high volume the treble will crack.  The iPlug is a simple 3.5mm plug that can plug into anything from the ubiquitous iPods to the cheap MP3 players you buy from Wal-Mart.  The sound is always solid with no distortion and you can tap into the EQ and build-in amp to adjust the sound.

The bottom line is ~ you really can not beat the price and quality of this inexpensive cd mp3 head unit.  I have no idea about the durability, but I am really happy about it at the momen

I am very disappointed in this product. I purchased the Blue Logger to use with a new Dell Axim X51v (which I purchased to use with the Blue Logger). I found that I could not make a Blue Tooth Connection between the Blue Logger and the handheld computer. I contacted Delorme & was told "At this time we do not offer any support or updates for Windows Mobile 5.0.  Hopefully in the future we will be able to offer updates for compatibility but currently there is no timeframe." What a ripoff. Delorme has a product that is not even compatible with the present PC Handheld operating system. 

I have also found that I cannot upload routes created on Street Atlas 2006 to the hand held. Basically I have a little electronic map with no functionality.

I agree with all the other feedback saying this product is faulty.  The on/off button is terrible.  It takes 5 tries to turn the unit off.  After 5 months of using this, the unit would no longer "talk" with the satellites.  I sent it back to DeLorme.  It tested bad.  Now I have waited 6 weeks for a replacement that is backordered.  Customer service rep will not refund your purchase after 30 days!  The software claims it will compute driving routes for you...but it will crash your PDA instead.  I had to buy INav IGuidance software (which is outstanding) to get software that will actually compute road routes for me.  I would not recommend this product to anyone.  It has been a complete waste of money for me

It is the year 2005. The 21st Century. We've put men on the moon. We've launched space probes to the edges of our solar system. We can even remotely drive little vehicles along the surfaces of other planets.

But we can't design a simply on/off button.

The on/off button for the Blue Logger is one of the most insanely stupid things I've ever encountered. Some mentally-challenged engineer somewhere decided that you have to hold the button 2-4 seconds to turn it on, and 2-4 seconds to turn it off.

It doesn't *sound* that difficult to do, but in practice it is infuriating, especially when you are trying to turn it on but end up turning it off. Right now the Blue Logger is sitting in front of me and I cannot turn it off. It simply will not turn off.

Oh, and I've had lots of problems connecting it to my Bluetooth adapter, and have yet to get Street Atlas USA 2005 to recognize it

I am trying to get this to work for the last 2 weeks ... unfortunately without success. I bought the bundle #3 (Bluelogger & Street Atlas 2005 & Street Atlas 2005 Handheld). The installation went fine, but I had problems in hooking up to bluetooth. I had to reset my HP iPAQ 2215 several times in this process and my IBM T30 (2.4 GHz and with 1GB RAM) was very slow ... not sure why this was.
Once I got the laptop to work, I took the Blue Logger out for a trip and downloaded the trip when I returned. Well, I coudn't make sense out the data the Blue Logger logged - the waypoints were almost all over the map. This was not the route I took.

I am still within the 30-day risk-free guarantee and try to return it next week.

Street Atlas 2005 HH provides wrong route and hard to use

I bought the blue logger and both Street atlas 2005 and SA2005 HH for my Dell X50V. No problem with the Blue Logger GPS but my complaints are as follows: 

1. Delorme did not include the Blue Logger Manager software on the HH. Now they want to sell it separately for additional $39. Very Weird marketing strategy indeed.

2. The software for the pocket PC is very difficult to use, not very intuitive. It seems the hand held software was developed as an afterthought from the software for the pc. It is poorly designed, and appeared was not fully tested by normal users prior to releasing to market.

3. It is very cumbersome and slow to determine a route. Even with a 620 MHz Axim, it is slow. Worse yet, the route is often wrong. FOr example, this afternoon I use SA2005 to determine a route to a friend's house. Had I followed that route, I would come to a dead end street and have to back track about 10 miles to get to another correct route to my destination. Luckily, I decided to use my paper map. Later, I tried Microsoft Mapping on the internet and it actually gave me the correct routing. Last week for another location, SA2005 found the wrong location for a given address which would take me about 4 miles off. Luckily, I knew where it was and ignored the routing from SA2005 HH.

4. Many other mapping softwares for HH will allow one to use it with 1 hand and often with the finger. But not with SA2005 HH. After 2 weeks of using it, I found myself going back to my old paper map. For example, if I had not calculated a route and just simply use the GPS and map to travel, the software only show the street I was on but no name given and no street name shown for upcoming cross streets. It does not help when you are lost.

5. SA2005 maps seems to be several years old and not very up to date. I guess that's why Delorme does not want to clearly advertise this issue.

I am seriously considering giving up SA2005 and consider this as my $50 learning mistake, and looking at Microsoft Street & Trip 2005 or later in 1Q 2005, IGuidance who is supposed to have the latest map. 

I am not alone in this as several other users have also complained on delorme user forum. I wish I had read that forum before buying Delorme software. Well, Live and Learn.

We bought this device with the express intent of capturing old VHS tapes and putting them into DVD format.  For that, it works and the bundled software meets the need.

However! 

This (VHS to DVD) is a long and slow process, so don't kid yourself into thinking that the MPEG4 HW decoding in this box is going to make that a super-fast process.  The actual "making" of the DVD movie is still very time consuming, as is the editing.  I'm not so impressed with WinDVD, but my son (who did most of the editing) preferred its ease of use over the Ulead product, which was also included.

We had trouble with one of the USB ports, even though all of the ports on the PC (purchased less than a year ago) are supposed to be high speed 2.0 USB.  But using another port allowed the device to be found and connected.

I wish there were some way to tell if frames are getting dropped.  Some video was pretty choppy (and didn't look that way on the VHS) but I couldn't quite figure out what was causing the problem, and it didn't repeat on later uses.

So far, we're happy we got it.  If the [...] arrives w/o too much struggle, I'll be even happier

I purchased the Plextor converter on advice of NERO.  They claimed that it would be compatible with their software.  After I plugged it in and tried to convert my tape, the system froze.  That happened several times.  I wrote about this to NERO, they asked me to send them a report.  I did that.  That was almost two weeks ago.  I am still waiting for a reply as they are notorious with their responses.  You may want to contact NERO directly, however, I doubt if it will work.

In future you may want to put some sort of safeguards in place referring to the software vendors with the description of your product(s).

Otherwise, I am very satisfied with the service I have received from you as I bought many other items through you.

Save yourself time and aggravation and DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT! I bought this to put home movies on DVD. Almost every time I downloaded a home movie to my computer the audio was not in sync with the video. I spent hours trying to get it right. I also kept upgrading my computer thinking that was the problem. I finally saw a review here explaining that the PX-M402U is notorious for this problem, so I bought a CANOPUS ADVC110 and have not had a single problem!

GREAT FOR CONVERTING TO DIGITAL FORMAT (AVI)

One of the reviewers said that this product records the video as an MPEG2 file and compromises the quality of the video because it is not saved as an AVI file.  Actually it DOES save the video as an AVI file!  The problem with AVI files is that they cannot be displayed on a TV set. You have to convert them into a format that can be read by the DVD player and displayed on your current TV.  Thus when you want to put that AVI file on a DVD, it is converted to MPEG2.  So MPEG2 is as good as it gets right now for normal digital video. For editing, you should leave your video in AVI format because editing MPEG2 causes further degradation of the video.

I have used this product for about a year now and it works great.  I initially had some problems with image/video quality but once I updated to the latest drivers from the companies website it worked fine.  This is probably why some of these reviewers gave it bad marks; because they didn't download the newest drivers available.  I got this to convert my old VCR tapes to DVDs and it worked perfectly.  The WinDVD software that is included is easy to use and works great.  My computer OS is Window XP.  Remember to look at the most recent reviews of this product; many of the latest drivers may not have been available for the earliest reviewers.  Great product!

I really love these speakers.  The fidelity of the bass is terrific (as per "Come on Closer" by Jem, say).  My regular system has Magnaplanar speakers with a subwoofer, and this system gives me much the same effect as the maggies--that the music isn't coming from a single point.  More like being in a concert setting than hearing sound from a box.

Quibbles?  The volume controls are nearly impossible to find, but that makes them inconspicuous once you've found them!  The subwoofer is not tiny in terms of fitting under a desk (12" diameter).  If you can't imagine yourself fidgeting with the fishbowl in stockinged feet you might pass on this item.  If you think you can handle that, however, you're going to love these speakers

I got the Soundsticks to use as a home stereo in a small room. I wasn't expecting superb sound quality and the Soundsticks really suprised me with the full and detailed sound they produce. Overall, the product is great value for money and the space it takes up. My only gripe is that there is no off button on them, so the only way to power off is to unplug them. I'm not sure how much power they use when idle, but not being able to power off is definitely a down side if you're energy conscious.

I just received my Soundsticks yesterday and could not be happier with their performance. I am using them to listen to streaming audio on my PC from a radio station in Italy that plays jazz and the nuances of that style of music are well suited to the Sound Sticks. The sleekness of the design is superb as well. The nice price makes this purchase a home run

I first saw these speakers at the Apple store, and i really liked the sound and the look.  I went on amazon and found a better price and i couldnt be happier with them.  As long as you have a decent soundcard, these speakers really are great.  i have had no problem with them at all, they look really cool, they're loud, they're small, the woofer gives you a lot of bass (which you can turn down), and the sound from the speakers is clear.  buy these

I've owned several sets of the original Soundsticks, and purchased this set for my wife's new Intel iMac. As always, the sound is amazing and plentiful, with the subwoofer providing strong thumping bass, and the sticks emitting crystal clear highs. We both love music, and we often fire up iTunes on the computer in the den, and the volume is good enough to fill the house. Our friends are always amazed at the sound these Soundsticks put out. I'm sure there are audiophiles out there who nitpick the output, but if you are just a regular joe who enjoys your music and appreciates good, clear and strong sound, I promise that you will not be disappointed with Soundsticks II

I'm not one to explain or understand most audio specs, compare systems or buy the most expensive audio components there are. This 3 piece self-powered speaker system was recommended by a coworker and the user reviews certainly helped in the decision making process. Still, I was doubtful, of course, as I love my gizmos and the price was under $120.00.  What kind of quality could this be for that price?

Let me tell you, I am blown away, ESPECIALLY considering the price!  Roughly $113.00, shipping and tax included and my whole 13x20 room rocks!  FYI, I listen to everything from Marvin Gaye, Nine Inch Nails, Acoustic to Beethoven.

It plugs in via the same adapter as your headphones so there are no delays in the subwoofer like what usually occurs with the USB connected woofers.  The plastic is a tough and heavy material so don't worry about them cracking under normal use, and since the sticks are tall, the base of the sticks are made of a heavy, rubbery material so they won't fall over or slide unless your head-banging on top of beer kegs.

The right Sound Stick contains the + & - volume adjustment sensors that take some time to get used to considering most computers have 2 other sources of volume control -the operating system's and the music player you use.  I call them sensors because they don't move, they are like those cool lamps that brighten and dim when touched.

Overall, if you a person who wants a nice sound system for your computer that you can hear from a few rooms away and are not sure what to buy or how much to spend, this is the way to go

The quality of the sound is very good indeed, I would say crystal clear. They were also a very good bargain. The design is also very different. The only disadnantage I have noticed, is that they do not have a on / off switch.

I use them to listen to music, classical or modern, either from my HP laptop, or from my mp3. 

I strongly recommend the Harman's for room use.

i purchased the DLO action jacket (neoprene for 20 & 40GB ipods) for my wife for use on walks, etc around town.  However, the ipod doesn't fit in properly.  The circle that is supposed to line up with the ipod's doesn't.  The plasic part covering the ipod is awkward and doesn't align either so you can't press the play button.  So, since the ipod doesn't fit in the case overall, this product is useless.  pls save your time and money and consider another ipod case

After looking around at the local stores (Fry's and CompUSA) I had just about given up on finding a single case that would offer reasonable protection for my iPod in multiple environments - on my belt and also in exercise, and had resigned myself to having a "skin" type case for just everyday use and then shifting the iPod to an arm band for exercise. Not a particularly great solution - expensive (around $20 for each) and a lot of shifting back and forth to cover both uses.

Then I ran into the DLO Action Jacket at Best Buy, which seemed to cover all my intended uses. Unlike the prior reviewer, I found my 40g iPod fits VERY snugly - absolutely zero slop, and I really like not having to worry about keeping up with more than one case. Also, at $29.95, it's cheaper than the two-case approach. The only criticism I have of this jacket is that when you want to convert from belt clip to sport use you have to snake the band through two loops on the backside of the case and over the little plastic belt clip receiver that protrudes from the back of the case. The process is a little tedious, but the end result is great. The unit feels very secure on my arm and it's easy to forget that it's there.

This jacket is a winner

This case is made of nice material.  Unfortunately the Ipod fits rather loosely in the case.  Also, one of the Velcro flaps on the top of the case covers the hold button on the Ipod.  The case takes away from the Ipod's good looks and slightly hinders usage of the buttons.  It doesn't do what I wanted it to do - stay out of the way and simply protect the MP3 player.  However, the case would be great to use just for jogging as it comes with a belt and clip that hold the Ipod firmly.

I have been trying to find a way to easily carry a lot of camera equipment for quite some time. I have tried backpacks, shoulder bags, duffel bags, but none of them really worked all that well. Then I saw the Lowepro Street and Field system with completely customizable pouches, vests, belts, and accessories. It works great, you only get the pouches you need so there is no waisted space and you can organize them however you want according to how often they are used (put frequently used items in easier to access places.) 

The variety alone of this system is worth the investment, but the quality and ease of use is also very high which is a big plus. You can get a case for any lens, camera body, or accessory you have. I even have cases for my cell phone and water bottle. One word of caution, be sure to measure your lens with the lens hood on backwards if you use them to make sure that the entire thing will fit into the pouch, because sometimes the lens will fit, but then the lens with the lens hood will not. I often carry 5-6 lenses, extension tubes, teleconverters, extra memory cards and batteries, and a bunch of cleaning supplies and other gadgets, which weights a ton. But when they are evenly distributed on this vest/belt Lowepro system it is actually very manageable. 

The only down side is that everyone will be staring at you because you have thousands of dollars of camera equipment strapped to your body. But if you can overlook that, this is the way to go. I have used this system at many zoos without ever having problems, in fact just unzipping a single lens and switching seems safer to me than opening an entire bag of equipment every time you want to switch lenses. Many of the cases also come with a built in rain/snow cover so if the weather changes all of your equipment is not destroyed. You can also put just a few pouches on a normal belt when you are just going to take photos in the back yard or don't need to take all of your equipment, which is nice. I really can't say enough about how much easier this makes traveling with a lot of equipment, if you have been hopelessly searching for a better solution, consider this, you won't regret it.

We currently have the Linksys BEFSR41 4-port router/switch for our home network.  It's been working great for about 4 years now, but we've now run out of ports.  I did some research on the 8 port router/switch product from Linksys, but the reviews were mixed.  The reviews were mixed for similar competing products also.  So I took the route of getting the EZXS55W to expand our existing home network.  I just plugged it into the network and it just worked out of the box.  No configuration needed.  It's also very tiny.  I highly recommend the product

Linksys tech support assured me that their were no limitations to this gizmos ability to route ethernet signals. Sure enough, I plugged it in and it's functioning exactly as I hoped. Our internet comes from a cable modem. From that I ran the cat-5 ethernet cable to the Airport Extreem which acts as a wireless router and it also has 1 out port for ethernet, which I connected the EZXS55W switch to. Off the switch I am running a printer (Laserwriter Pro 630) and a desk top G-4. I also have 3 wireless computers on the network and all are running OS-X. All can access the internet, I can print from any computer and fileshare between the whole lot. I couldn't ask for more

I have nothing to report, that is, the device has performed flawlessly in the 2+ years I have owned it.  I subjected this thing to almost every scenario except Mac.  Read on...

I used it at my office (at a major research university) where I connected, among other things, a vintage (circa 1999) Windows XP desktop, a Dell Inspiron 6000 laptop with XP, two variants of the Dell dual XEON workstations running RedHat 8+/-1 and Fedore Core, an IBM Thinkpad laptop running XP, a custom built AMD Athlon 2800+ running every major linux distribution except Debian as well as XP, and a custom built AMD 4400+ dual core machine running Suse 10.  Network cards ranged from motherboard-based to 0 and 4 year old Netgear cards.

I used cables from 3 to 30 feet long and connected this to both a brand new wall jack and a retrofitted jack in a Cold War era building.  Finally, the room this equipment operated in was subjected to temperatures from 55 F to 110 F, as my office was not air conditioned during the summer and it was colder outside at 100 degrees (the above computers made a lot of heat).

We had major power outage/surge problems which didn't faze this thing one bit, but were able to ruin more than one expensive APC UPS unit.

Oh, and I downloaded at least 100 GB through this card during this period

Purchased this product lookig for a switch that allowed me to connect multiple systems to my home network.   And it does that function exceptionally well.  I had multiple printers & PC's to connect, and this switch handled multiple connection speeds flawlessly.   Stylish and extremely small, it fits on my desktop without taking up very much space (approx 4.5" wide x 3.5 inches deep).  All cables and connectors are on the back.  The front panel led's for each port display link/act, Duplex, and connect speed.
The only thing that needs improvement on this switch is the "user guide" included with the product.  There are 6 ports on this switch.. ports 1-5 and an 'uplink' port.  But use of the uplink port disbles the use of port 5, leaving 4 ports for your peripheral devices.   This is a bit confusing, as the device is advertised as a 5 port workgroup switch.  A quick trip to [...] downloading the 'quick-start guide' (which was not included with the product) did a much better job of explaining the use of the uplink and 5th ethernet port.   Overall, buy this product if you need a small switch for additional devices.  Can't be beat for the price, in my opinion

We've had this printer for almost two years. I do a good amount of printing, both color & b/w. While I do need to do cleanings more often with this printer, mine is not sucking up ink at an unreasonable rate at all. And it is very affordable. Photos don't always print well... the only photo paper I have found to work well with my S530D was very the glossy trial pack that came with it when I bought it. No other photo paper has done well at all, so I suggest theirs. This is the best printer we have had in 10 years, and belive me I've thrown my share out the window! I can offer THIS advice to owners of ANY printers. Always use the power switch ON THE PRINTER to turn it on off, never use the power strip switch, or the switch from properties. For some reason doing so supposedly wastes ink? I don't get it, but I've always followed that advice and this printer has been an absolute gem for us. Good Luck! Jeanni

I have had this printer for more than a year.  At first, it was a great printer. Not anymore!!  It uses up ink like no other, yes, it is great to have the individual tanks(which is why I bought the thing) but now the print head isn't working right.  Do several deep cleanings and use up nearly all the full tanks up, and the problem is still there.  The pages have splotchy black marks and the texts are only partially printed.  Went to the canon website, they don't even acknowledge this printer ever existed.
My recommendation is don't buy this model!!

This printer prints fast but the quality is poor. Consumer reports rates it a best buy but I disagree. Pictures come out very graney and its almost worthless to have a 2 megapixel or higher camera because the quality will not be seen with this printer. I do not recommend this printer to anyone. I bought the Cannon to replace a Hewlett Packard deskjet 932C and it was slow but the picture quality was superior to the Cannon. This purchase was a real dissapointment

I purchased this printer with the intent to use it for both photo printing and regular text printing. Photos look great and print relatively quickly, but I had a problem with white streaks when printing text. I ended up calling Canon support and they sent me a new printer head for free since the printer is still under warranty. I've had no problems since. I give the printer a high rating mainly because I was very satisified with their tech support

My brother has the Netgear WG511T Super G 108 PC Card for his notebook and it works great.  So after I thought my Dell notebook internal wireless chip died, I decided to order a notebook adapter for it.  Instead of getting another Netgear I decided to go with the D-Link DWL-G650 Cardbus Adapter 108Mbps - my first experience with a D-Link product.  The G650 works great - plugged the card into the adapter slot, turned on the notebook, 5-10 minutes configurations and WOLA I got on the internet.  The card works flawlessly without any signal dropped or any compatibility problem with my Westell 327W router.  I notice the wireless signal is stronger and the connection is faster than the notebook internal wireless adapter or the WUSB12 Linksy adapter which I used prior to obtaining the G650.  The G650 supports WEP, WPA, WPA-PSK security encryption and comes with an intuitive and easy to use configuration utility

All,
 I Have used this card to connect to various routers and it works well. The Extreme G mode is problematic to enable sometimes. New drivers are available, make sure you down-load the right one. D-Link how about having an automatic update command ?, instead of letting the user figure out which card version he has ?.

The main reason I got this card is because it working in Linux (It has an atheros chipset), and it delivers.  It works great, and the range is awesome.
For Windows users, it works great in XP as well.

Overall, I am very satisfied with this wireless card

I decided to dust off a 5-year old laptop (Winbook Z1) the other day and install Ubuntu on it. I selected this card because of the Atheros chipset. I can't believe how easy it was to get it working. I plugged it in, installed Ubuntu and the new OS recognized the card. With in minutes I was on the internet, thanks to my neighbor's open WiFi. After a few hours of reading some wiki's and messages, I had WPA running and my "new" Linux laptop was on my network. Piece of cake! Great card and great chipset

This D-Link wireless 802.11g wireless AirPlusXtremeG adapter is amazing. The first amazing thing, is that it seems to lose your connection all the time. This seems to be because of some problem D-link has with "Authentication". If you want yours to work, turn off authentication. Once you have it running reliably, it is amazingly fast. I run on a cable modem and get about 1.1 megabytes per second on a wired connection normally, and yet I have exceeded that with my AirPlusXtremeG (about 1.15). My point is that it works like a wired connection without the hassle of wires, but with the added hassle of needing to set it up EXACTLY right. This doesn's seem to be a problem if you don't use security, but with security, be prepared to visit at least one forum for tips on set-up. I recommend [...]. They have many people who are experienced with this adapter and the routers that are used with it

This is very well designed. It give you 4 USB Port but two on opposite sides. This is very clever becase you have plug in devices from both sides. You webcam or cell on your left and your mouse and number pad on your right. The cord that plug in from the Hub to the Computer is very sterdy yet flexible so you can not only adjust the Hub in all kind of angles, it would stay at that angle and not twist all around you wires. It also works great if you jsut want to charge you USB devices on the go. It come with a plug in AC adapter so you don't need to bring your computer along with you to charge youd devices

I,ve seen complaints about the ac adapter you "must" plug in. Hey guys, try it without an outside energy source, I just hope I,m not gonna fry something but it seems to work fine just plugged into a powered USB port. I have a VERY high end system though with wattage to sprare, but no more PCI slots, Damn 7900 512 gtx graphics cards, why do 2 of em have to take up so much room. Oh well, trade offs are a bi---, but a reality and 7 extra USB slots are awfully nice

It's speedy and space saving and inexpensive. I bought this to replace my Belkin because the Belkin needed to be plugged in. This one is powered by your computer so there's no extra power cords, which is a big plus to me. 

The only thing I dislike about this is the fact that the Hub takes up two Usb ports instead of just one like the Belkin.

PROS

Small
Cute
Self-powered - comes with a power adaptor.  I have 6 devices hooked up to it, including 2 USB Hard Drives, and it works fine without the adapter - a big plus for me. Most hubs would not work with this setup.
USB 2.0 & 1.1 - 6 devices hooked up, 3 low speed and 3 high speed, all work very well.
Runs cool.

CONS

Not sure why, but they put the 7 ports on one side of the hub and power/uplink ports on the other.  This is dumb.  If you have the hub on a desk it looks awkward.  All ports should be on the back and leds on the front.  Here, the leds are next to each port which makes them completely useless as you don't see them.  
The hub is very light so when you have lots of devices hooked up the font gets a elevated.

Overall, the best hub I've ever had and I tried many

It's a simple device, so there's not to say about it other than it does the job. You should note that the LEDs on the device remain lit as long as the device is plugged into your PC and the PC is powered (they glow a bright blue).

You will appreciate this product only if you don't have enough USB ports. In my case, I had plenty of ports, but needed an extension cable, which would help me in plugging the flash drives, whithout bending down and plunging into the cave of wires(I keep my CPU, under the table).The only complaint I have is the the wire lenght is not long enough.
Overall good value for price

I have been using the Sansa mp3 player now for almost a year. It's a great item, especially for the price. Was very easy to download my music and set up. I purchased a better brand of earphones, seeing I would be using mine mostly on an airplane. It holds more than enough songs. 
I am going to purchase one for my granddaughter for her Christmas present this year

As you have read other reviews, the earphones could be better, sometimes you will hear music out of both, sometimes one or the other.  The only issue I have with it, is if someone downloads music on to it with another computer, you cannot pull the songs off with your computer.  Maybe I am missing something or doing something wrong, but over all it's not bad.

I purchased the Sansa (512MB) player for a hinking trip and I have to say it works GREAT. The only complaint that I would have is that the unit is a bit bulk for todays standards, but not to bad.

If you are looking for a no-frills MP3 player than this unit is a great value! Plus it comes in larger memory sizes and a built in radio to boot! The single AAA battery that the unit takes goes a long way too

I purchased SanDisk about 2 months ago and so far I am very satisfied with its performance. I was looking for a chepear alterantive to Ipod as I am not an avid music listner and SanDisk was the just the right product. Loading music on it is real simple using Windows media player. Battery life is excellent. I also use it to tune into FM channels while at gym or when I want to catch up with days news at work. The FM reception is quite good for something this small without an antenna. I even have dropped  it atleast on three occassion and so far it seems to work just fine. Touch wood !! 
Overall a great product for its price  !

I will buy an IPOD in due time, but for right now, the SanDisk Sansa is the perfect one start off with. I didn't want to spend a lot of money for an item I never use before. I just want to listen to music without carrying cds/cd player and the fancy stuff (examples: video viewing; combination cell phone). 

The MP3 is easy to program your music (make sure you have Windows XP on your desktop [computer] or laptop). This player is also a recorder and has FM radio.  The items that come with this are instruction booklet, mini cd to set-up on computer system (I was able to program music without this cd), plastic cover, velco strip clip-on, earphones, and the connection cord (USB).

Simple and basic, this is the one (PS because the SanDisk Sansa doesn't look expensive, pickpockets and theives are not trying to to steal it like an IPOD).

I just got my mouse today I was ecstatic about the performance I had initial problems installing the mouse but after I unplugged it and plugged it in again the problems went away. I have to agree with my other comrades from this site this is the best mouse for the price and I have no problems whatsoever except for the look which I thought was the result from damage from shipping but it was designed like that so I have no complaints

I was using a MX510 prior to getting this. There is a slight upgrade in performance from the 510. The ability to adjust the sensitivity on the fly wasn't that useful. It was hard to adjust to the different levels and it would change the sens setting in game. So, I set the mouse software to the highest level and adjusted the in game settings to where it felt good. The biggest difference I felt is it's easier to make longer range shots, I'm sure because of the higher resolution of the 518 over the 510.

that you can switch on the fly
</reviewer_location>
<review_text>
Alright, I got this mouse to replace the shoddy touchpad on my laptop. This thing is certainly worlds better than any touch pad, lol. 

What made this mouse appeal to me over any other is that the traditional Logitech shape of it is very comfortable to me, the internet navigation buttons are very conventient, and the high resolution optics (that you can switch on the fly)- since I use my laptop for playing games. 

I'm a fan of the G5 gaming mouse, and after using it for so long, I just can't go back to a normal resolution mouse without cringing. The MX518 provided a cost effective alternative over the G5, since I would be taking  it around with me, it would matter less if it got broken in transit or solen. Also, the button layout on my laptop is different than my desktop keyboard, so I wanted both the forward and back internet navigation buttons. 

My only gripes are mostly that this isn't a G5, lol. There's no DPI indicator, the on-the-fly resolution buttons aren't ergonomically placed (the forward one feels like it's a mile away when you try to press it), and as a user of wireless mice for so long, and a fully weighted G5, I like heavy mice... And the MX518 is just too light for me to really feel natural with it. I hate to say it because the mouse performs great, but it just feels cheap because of how light it is. 

So, as a portable gaming mouse, I give this a 4. If you're looking for a cost effective gaming mouse, or something hi-res for graphics design, this is a good bet. But if you want to go all out, buy something higher end because you will be more satisfied with the higher end product.

This mouse plays great for my games like CS Source and 1942. It is real nice to be able to change the mouse speed in game. Which helps a lot if your playing games like 1942 and you need to go from first person to flying a jet. However the reason I give it a 4 stars is that after playing for a few hours the mouse's design is such that it has a sharp bend right where your right ring finger rests and it can get to be hurting, especially if you play a lot of FPS type games where your holding and moving the mouse constantly

I've gone through about 6 different mice, and each one had their pros and cons (mostly cons).  I finally found the MX518, and trust me, you don't know what you're missing until you've used it.  *Edit: how did I find it?  On SK-Gaming, there are tons of threads about "what's the best mouse"?  This mouse came up so frequently that it seemed like a no-brainer.

This is the first time I can use a mouse and never have to worry about unexpected friction or hiccups.  It controls with extreme precision and ease.  At first, it was a little hard for me to get used to the shape and size, since it feels different from other mice I've used...but once I got used to it, it's flawless.

I am also a pretty avid gamer, and since I got this mouse, my performance has gone up noticeably.  In fact, that's the reason I got this mouse to begin with: my biggest weakness in-play was my inability to consistently click quickly on small units in battle.  With the MX518, those kinds of dumb problems go away.

Another thing I love is that even if I used it for hours, my hand feels completely rested and fresh.  No more taking quick hand breaks, stretching it out or what not.

It's also very easy to customize the speed and feel of the mouse using the software.  I've read some complaints about it, but I can't see any way to improve it.

Coupled with my Steelpad S&S mousepad, it's so much more fun to get on the computer.  Like upgrading car audio, you really don't know what you're missing until you get rid of your outdated junk and try the best

unsure about Game Boy Micro
</reviewer_location>
<review_text>
For those who dont what it is the Nintendo E Reader is an add on that goes into the cartridge slot of GBA and SP (unsure about Game Boy Micro). There is a paper thin slot in the bulky add on in which you scan cards to play classic nes games, game and watch games, Animal Crossing Cards, Mario Bros 3 Cards, Pokemon TCG Cards or Promo cards given out through Nintendo Power such as Kirby Slide. The scanner is easy to use and has little trouble reading the cards.

Whats Included: Included In one new E reader is the E Reader accesory,the Classic Nes game Donkey Kong Jr, and a sample pack which includes : 3 Pokemon TCG Cards (Machop,Machoke, and Machamp), One Game and Watch Card (Manhole), and Animal Crossing Present Card.

Classic NES Games: E Reader Classic Nes Games are sold in Packs that now Retail for 1 or 2 dollars each. In the pack is 5 cards that have a code on the top and bottom, that when scanned create a perfect playable NES game. You might be thinking If the game has glitches or any other problems the answer is no. The only noticable Difference is in the Donkey Kong JR game screen appears to be a bit smushed to fit the screen.Classic Nes Games are the main reason to buy the E reader cause of there great quality and quantity.

Mario Bros 3 Cards: E cards That when linked to a game boy advance/SP with Super Mario Advanced 4: Mario Bros 3 can create levels, show video demonstration of secrets, or Give You Power ups.

Pokemon Trading Cards: Whenn Nintendo bought the pokemon trading card game they aded some special features. All cards from the Pokemon EX Series have codes on the bottom that when scanned give you information about that pokemon. Now heres where the E Reader's True Poteneial Shows, some cards have codes on the side that when combined with that pokemons evolution's(other form's) side codes create a minigame. The 3 Pokemon Cards included have a Minigame when Combined giving you a perfect demonstration. Also included in pokemon Ruby and Saphire is a card that when combined with the e reader lets your team battle a series of trainers.

Animal Crossing cards: While linking a Game Boy Advance with an e reader to a Game Cube with animal crossing you can give yourself items and letters using the special machine located in the animal crossing post office.

Game and Watch cards: Using one card with 2 bar codes on it you can play a Game and Watch Game. The only one on card ever created was Man Hole. A Game and Watch series was planned but was later dropped.

Mario party E: Thhe Only E reader game in its own category: Mario party e Includes 64 cards a Game Board and instructions. In this Mixture of board Game and Video Game you scan various cards and play minigames to get coins or items from your opponent.

Overall: The E Reader is now abondoned by nintendo meaning most likely no new games will ever be released (As it has been this way for 2 years). It is cheap to buy and works wonderfully. But due to lack of any future support you should only buy it if you are in to Nes Games, Animal Crossing, or Pokemon EX Cards. If you are into any of those than you will love this product and i recomend it.

People who dont know hat theyre talking about bug me. The E reader is great, but im here to clear up some mis-conceptions. 

1. THE E READER WORKS W/ GBA SP. You have to open it first, but then it fits. duh.

2. The E-Reader does NOT have the games already on it. The games are actually in the dot codes. Hard to believe, but true. They are not already on ur E Reader. Nintendo has dropped support of it because it was somewhat of a flop and they were gearing up 4 the D

This is great even if you have the NES games. For one you can bring it anywhere and it doesn't have 2 player mode. It IS compatible with GBA SP because it does not require the game link port on the SP. The only flaw is you need to scan 10 cards to play one NES game and you can only save one at a time. Still, that won't stop you cuz when you get proficient at swiping them, its nothing. But the e-Reader does more than NES games; you may play e-Readers from Nintendo Magazines, you can play Game & Watch games, look at Pokemon (who cares about that feature???), connect to games like Super Mario Bros. 3 and get power-ups as well as new levels, and hook up to a Gamecube for double experience. The only problem is to connect to games you need 2 Game Boys and a link cable but that it isn't too much of a problem. Also, e-Reader packs are fairly cheap even in New York City. Gameplay and graphics are faithful to the originals, too

I am very happy with my purchase. The Ipod is so expensive and not nearly as efficient. My sister has one and I have 3 times as many songs on my bean. I have found that even dropping it several times, im clumsy, that despite what I originally thought it has withheld very well.
I do not like the fact that you pretty much are forced to use sony software but it is quick and easy to use

Short and quick.
Software is easy to use, but because Sony uses ATRAC, you can't play the songs on another program (Windows etc.) you downloaded or saved from a cd to the SONY program.  But the program is very easy to use.
The player itself is very small (including the buttons).  I purchased it strictly for the gym and long plane trips.  It hold a ton of songs (500+) Why you need more that that I don't know.  It also has a FM stereo receiver, so it is cool as well.
In total, it is compact and easy to use.  Perfect for the gym, running fanatic

Notice, all the happy....five star ratings, are from people that JUST bought this MP3. I have had mine for 9 months. 

I have had this MP3 since Christmas 2005. I bought the white 512 for my son at the same time. Whith in 3 weeks, my son's was no longer working at all, he had it in his back pack, and some how it got crunched enough to never work again!! I was not happy. Also in a few months, mine started to have issues. The very "tiny" menu button is rediculous. And the main toggle was a complete failure for Sony. I accually removed the cover to the toggle, and just moved the joy stick under it, to change songs, or volume. How stupid. I am so mad about this MP3 player. I am going to buy a Creative V. I have done a lot of research this time, and I will not buy another Sony. The hold button, that is part of this sliding door never works, I find the player dead in my gym bag, all the time!!! Apparently, the door slides over a bit, and the player will turn on, FOR HOURS, and than you have a dead player. Maybe Sony should have given us a on/off button, than this would not happen! Dont do it folks, look into other options, even my mom's iPod Nano is better designed than this joke of an MP3 player.

I purchased this item initially because of the price, compared to the IPOD's.  I LOVE it! My husband has the video IPOD and his battery needs charged every day.  I have never had to charge this MP3 player yet! It goes for 50 hours- I ordered the mini sony speakers for it so I can listen to it at work on my desk or anywhere.  The only downside is that Sony quit making the armband for it so I am having a hard time finding a holder for it. It fit my needs perfectly

Good thing first, efficient on battery,convenient and compact..doubles up as flash drive and no cables except headphone to carry around to charge. Thats it.

As most of the other reviewers have said this product is absolutely useless because of low IQ software people working in SONY. utterly non user friendly.
I develop software for a living and I am not afraid to use new software...even though I was able to use the software the main drawbacks are the over smartness of software where it tries to control the music piracy..
I had 1gb of Atrac songs on this player from my computer. Then one day my computer HDD crashed. I was kind of thankful that I had saved atleast 1 GB of music on this bean walkman. Atleast all the hours I spent in transfering did not go waste.
As soon as I fixed the new HDD and tried to transfer the songs back to my computer..the useless sony softwre will not take the music files back...I tried every trick and even the sony customer support could not help me( a very indifferent group of people). It is a rotten piece of software and that makes this efficient device a waste of money.

Of course transfering the files to this player is an entirely diff story and I dont want to go abt that..

It is absolutely infuriating

The bean is small, battery efficient, and has a nice overall look to it. Thats probably the only few good things that can be said about this product. This is NOT an mp3 player, it is a TRAC player. You have to convert all your mp3's into TRAC format before the player is able to play them. You also have to install their software which for most of us is an intrusive program trying to list every music file on your HD....this can ussually result in other people knowing what music you own especially if the software regularly communicates online. Another horror youll deal with is the slow transfer speed this device has. Just to load a single 3 meg file took an avg of 35 seconds, imagine how long 60 5 meg files would take. If your looking for an mp3 player that lets you just drag and drop your fav mp3s into the device so you can hear them hassel free this in not the player for you. This device is the Stalin of mp3 player requiring strict uncomfortable conformity play your fav songs

The walkman is easy to use with enough memory for my meager uses.  The sound is excellent, but I use an older set of Sony head phones rather then the ear pieces that came with the set.

The unit recharges very quickly and again for my uses last a long time.

It is quite small and the only disadvantage I've found is there is no clip or arrangement to carry it except a pocket

First off let me state for the record that I only buy Sony , but I have to
advise you against the purchase of the bean walkman. I purchased one in March 2006 and returned it September 2006, as I had purchased replacement
insurance and was able to return it because it broke. It is hard to turn off and the usb port cover always pops open, not to mention the headphones
always pull out. The FM receiver is hard tune in the daylight as the screen is invisiable. Save your self the hassel!!!!!

I just ordered the second one for our family.  It's the 3rd Sony MP3 player to join our househould.  They've been very dependable, and they're easy to use.  The software is simple.  The sound is great, and the batteries hold a charge for an incredible amount of time.  My teenagers (girls) love that they come in colors, and they're different than what most of their friends have.  Mom loves that they're affordable

This is the greatest little MP3 player!!! The sound is great (good bass), the size is very convenient and everybody who see it, wants one. It fits in a pocket, has an armband option or a key ring option, even little speakers as an option. I've taken it on so many trips. There is a caution though, even though the software is good for Windows Plus or better, you can not download from the web unless you have Windows XP

Hardware awesome, software a flop. Since you HAVE to use their software the package is destroyed. I will give you the final nail on the coffin for me. I tried to put Podcasts on the device using the latest SonicStage 4. No chance. It wants to be able to find each "artist" in the Sony library. This was bad for the odd bit of music it could not find but obviously it can not find the podcasts in their library.

I had bought one of these and had considered one for the girlfriend - no chance now. Shame as the hardware was A1

This is my first portable mp3 player and it took me about an hour to go from taking it out the box to having music on it and for me to learn how to work the controls. I did have to read the manual for a few minutes to understand what "hold" meant on the screen - but other than that - very nice little product, good price, and very easy to use

 Well, to begin with, I am a complete iPOD hater. The whole idea of wasting an buttload of money on something with limited features doesn't sit right with me. But after robbing my bro of his for so long, since I had none, it was time to get something of my own. I chose this Walkman Bean player. The size is sick! Fits between a few fingers. Also, it is Sony, a trusted company, unlike Apple who will give you the runaround. The navigation and menu is so simple. I didn't read the manual and I figured it out. The only thing I read the manual for was to figue how to change the station on the radio, but that is negligible. Anyhow, I looooove it. Great bargain, sound investment

Pay a little more and buy an IPOD.  It interfaces with PCs and Macs equally well.

I loved this player until the day I really, really needed to use it for recording, when I discovered that the MODE button no longer worked. This is the button you need to use to switch from mp3 player mode to voice record, line-in record, or FM radio. 

The device is now permanently stuck on mp3 player mode with no ability to shuffle or repeat, which is not the worst thing in the world, except that I specifically bought it for its recording capabilities which are now, for all intents and purposes, non-existent. And 14 months after I bought it, too; conveniently post-warranty.

The screws holding the case together are impossible to remove, so there's no way to attempt a DIY solution to this maddeningly simple but nonetheless irreperable device-crippling problem. This thing is of no use to me now; a $200 paperweight. I'm never buying another iRiver product again

It got to me quickly, even before the estimated arrival date, in perfect condition. It blows away my last MP3 player. And best of all, Microsoft and/or Apple don't have their hands in this device. No playsforsure. No i-tunes. That's the best part. I pity all of you with i-pods and playsforsure mp3 players. You'll never know what it's like to not be a corporate lacky unless you get an MP3 player like this one.

It's worth the price

I had this exact iRiver and when I loaned it out, it got lost. So he offered to replace it with even a "better" mp3 player that would show photos, etc.  I asked for an exact replacement because I love everything about this mp3 player, it fits my needs perfectly.

The features I love are that it has both voice and radio record and you can also record from your stereo or cassette or whatever audio source using the line-in feature. It has tons of space more than I've ever used, and the small size and sound quality is great!

I have seen some people write that they didn't like the buttons or had problems with turning it off and on accidentally, but I personally have never had that problem, as long as I slide the hold button over to the lock position. I like that it gives a cord to hang it around my neck, or to put it on my arm.. however I rarely use the armband.

The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because you cannot view photos on it, even tho you can store and transfer them. I personally don't need that feature, but others may prefer it. 

I Love my iRiver

Very good MP3 player, can do everything you need, good for sport, joging. The only thing I miss a little bit is RDS feature. Also if you upload songs on it, you can download it back to PC (e.g. to friends PC), so can't be used as a USB key (well, i guess it's not the main feature, but would be nice)

This player is great all around.  Small compact size with sport arm band included makes work-outs a whiz!  The only draw back I've found so far is that is doesn't play .wma files.  The sound through my upgraded sony headphones is awesome and equalizer can be set to your desired mix.  The battery lasts at least 1.5 weeks with daily use.

I'm very pleased with this mp3 player, it may nota have a very big storage but it seems to be enough, of course it depends of every person, I think it's better than any other player of 1 Gb, got FM,record from almost any device, uses AA batteries, it's got a great sound.

The only con, is that it is not recognized as a removable disk, it needs the driver!

I wanted a non-iPod digital music player, and found this to be a terrific option.  It plays a number of different formats, and includes a lanyard, which is nice when commuting on the train, or for plane travel.  I have only used alkaline batteries so far, and have had excellent battery life.  The menu takes an hour or 2 of playing with to learn, but once you get familiar with the buttons and menu, it's pretty easy.  I have also enjoyed the built in FM tuner, and have not any trouble with reception, even on a moving commuter train.  The sound quality is very good.  I've been using 128 bitrate MP3 songs so far.  The software for transferring music is pretty easy to use, although I did have a little trouble getting the player to be recognized as connected, which seemed to be some kind of order of connections issue.  The included earbuds aren't the most comfortable, especially since I already lost the foam padding, but I will probably get a better pair anyway.  They do sound good though.  Also, the included cases are pretty cheesy and I didn't even bother with them.

A little hint:  One thing I did not like was that because of the location of the on button, the unit can fairly easily be turned on when you have it stored in a bag or pocket.  To combat this, simply turn the Hold on.  The unit won't turn on accidentally when it's on

I purchased one of these when new back in 2004.  The unit has worked ok for me, with the main quirk being about once every hour or two, I go through a 3 - 5 minute period of bad reception, presumably as it shifts from one satelite to another.  I was unable to utilize the fm modulator as it was weak, but went to a hard wired connection to my radio using a cable purchased from Crutchfield.  

My main issue with this unit is that there are newer units available for the same or slightly more money, which have replay options and better displays.  I would consider those options before purchasing this unit

I have two seperate units.  One hardwired to my car, and the other is the JVC unit.  I hooked it directly into the audio (aux) ports of my Radio, rather than use an fm station.  It works great, the sound quality is excellent as well - (and my radio is so old it play's 8-tracks!!!!).  I did notice that the unit tends to run a bit warm to hot.  I agree with the previous reviews, that it is something that JVC needs to look into, perhaps it is simply a matter of a "heat sink-er" not being in specs, as yet, I have encountered no problems (having had the JVC unit for 1.5 years)  No matter.  As to the commercial free: Sirius (which I have had a subscription to for the past 4 years) has commercial free radio, though the news stations and a few others do have commercials.  Those stations are clearly defined as being in the commercial block.  The music stations are 100% free of commercial. 

All in all a damn cheap price to pay for avoidance of all those really irritating DJ's, commerical's, and lack of variety in stations!  ~Cheers!

For the longest time I really didnt think $12 a month was worth this kind of radio but after buying the sr-2000 and getting it all hooked up in my car I soon changed my mind. 
Biggest thing for me is hardly any DJ talking, they really keep the music going. I noticed on a couple other reviews this was not the case, I listen to only the rock stations so I cant comment on other stations. I live in the Seattle area and using the FM modulator really sucked, every station had static. I found an audio input cable online to fit my car stereo for a direct connection and oh man what a difference!!  Crystal Clear!  I did have to play with the bass and treble a bit to get the best sound and since I have a sub-woofer I used the fader a couple of clicks to the front (away from the sub) and really got it sounding great.
It doesnt sound as good as a CD but much better than regular Radio. So I bought another car kit and I have the boom box for in the house. I did notice the unit getting a little warm but nowhere near hot

I purchased this receiver in December 2005. It worked like a champ until February 2006 when it began to have issues with decoding the satellite signal.

The unit works for five minutes from cold start up, then the audio cuts out. Display still shows program info. Being an experienced PC user, I turned the unit off and back on, repeatedly. The message "Acquiring Signal" displays permanently, even though the Antenna Aiming screen shows full SAT and TER signal bars.

My best guess is that a ROM or RAM chip cooked. This unit runs hot! JVC has been less than helpful. It sucks to have to landfill  a $100 piece of hardware, but no one will touch it. It's my last purchase from JVC.

Glad I didn't purchase the Sirius "lifetime" license

This Unit performs well, both in the car and home.  It performs best at home as you can plug it right into your stereo vs. using a unused FM frequency.  This might work ok in rural areas, but in urban areas how long is the FM frequency "unused"?  In my experience living in Chicago, not very far.  then you get static and fumble to change the frequency to another unused station. Plus you have this thing hanging out from your dash, very noticable expecially to theives so it's then one more then you have to remove and hide or take with you. If you want Sirius in your car, invest in a head unit and be done with it. 

This unit works great at home and if you get an extra kit, you can take it to your office and hook it up there.  It has a remote and I've had no problems with it whatsoever at home.  Like I said, for the car I ended up getting a separate head unit and would advise people to do the same

I think this is a very good receiver. A number of people have complained about issues with the wireless FM Modulator and the static that is causes. I would say that there is some static at times, but most of the time I have not had this issue. However, I will clarify that statement, by noting that if you are traveling long distances, you most likely will have to switch the FM Frequency a few times during the trip (In my case it was a two hour trip from Sacramento to the Bay Area) as the station you are set to will likely not be free for that entire time. However, it is very easy to switch the frequency, so I was able to adjust it without any difficulties. 

As for the receiver itself, I like the compactness of it and it does not take long to figure out how to go through the various menus, save stations, etc. I did not care much for the suction cup that is part of the car kit. Although it worked fine on my car window, I really didn't want it there, so I actually just use the cradle and place it in one of my cupholders, but this is a personal preference. 

I would definitely recommend this receiver to my friends.

First of all I thought Sat radio advertised " Commercial Free radio" was that. IT IS NOT AT ALL!!!! In fact I spend most of my time looking over the 160 chanels for something not with commercials. (...). They claim they have nothing to do with that. So this is a good buy IF you want another radio player WITH commercials (  A lot of them ) and to pay for it. I got this because I was tired of radio commercials and awful radio announcers who talked over songs and too much. Well sattelite radio is the same thing just with cussing. So keep this in mind before you buy.

I bought the boom box and the car kit. The FM Modulator has a much better reception than when I have it in the boom box at home.  Unlike others, I have perfect reception with the wrieless modulator..at least for now.  I'm going ahead and buying the home aentenna to get a better reception for when I use the boombox at home.

All in all, Great buy and I can't wait for STERN

I recently bought this radio, primarily for my car, but also got the home dock. It was easy to set up and install both types of kit. Unfortunately, the sound quality was very poor in both configurations. The FM modulator for the car was pretty close to hopeless. It only has maybe 10 channels. I found one that was free, luckily. But even with a clear channel, the sound had a terrible hiss, that went up and down in volume at apparent random even when everything was stationary. The occupied channels actually worked about as well (still lots of hiss)- except when the underlying channel broke through. Even disregarding the hiss, the sound quality on the music was not very good. 

   I thought the problem was probably with the FM modulator, so I tried it in the home dock, connected to a *very good* home hi-fi system. The hiss was gone, but the sound quality was completely unacceptable. For whatever reason, this particular receiver doesn't like the compression artifacts very much. Satellite radio quality is, AT BEST, about like an average MP3, with highly compressed signals (some channels better than others). This receiver seemed to exacerbate the effect, and it sounded a lot like a tin can and string "telephone" most of the time. It was vert irritating very quickly. 

   The form factor (about the size of a modern walkie-talkie) was fine, and pretty easy to fit in the car. It also seemed to be pretty solidly built. But all of that is completely moot if it doesn't work properly. 

      I returned the receiver and both kits the next day.

This was the first flash drive I bought, and I liked it enough to buy a second one.  I've since given both of them away, as I am using a 4GB other brand with a retractable plug in.  However, I'm buying a few more of these right now, so that I will have them on hand to give to student advisees who really need one, as they are so inexpensive.  The only thing that keeps me from giving it a 5-star rating is that the caps are easy to lose, altho each drive comes with two extra caps, which helps.  The slim line also makes it very easy to carry or store, and it fits easily into USB ports that might be a tight squeeze for other brand flash drives.

when i got to work and plugged it into my computer it started right up. no problems whatsoever.  i don't know whether or not it would survive it i did it again, but for this one time, it performed brilliantly. thanks, cruzer!

First of all, the shipping on this item costs more than the item itself.  I did get it quickly (2 or 3 days), but I had several problems with it:

(1) I repeatedly tried it on my DVD player and the player hung.  Each time I had to unplug it and plug it back in to get it to respond.  I tried over 10 times and got the same result each time.

(2) I tried it on DVD drive 1 on my computer and it hung as well.  Had to Ctrl-Alt-Del to get my DVD player software to close.  On the 3rd attempt it actually did work.

(3) I repeatedly tried it on DVD drive 2 on my computer. Each time I got a message saying "no disk".

I consider it item a waste of money

I was about to retire an old standalone DVD recorder, because it would no longer let me create menus or finalize discs.  I bought this lens cleaner and -- voila! -- the recorder is working again.  Super easy to use (it's simply a DVD that you insert into your machine, and the menus tell you what to do).  Highly recommended

No matter how many USB port I had, I always seemed to need more. I had ports on my computer, more on my monitor, even two on my keyboard, and still I needed more.

After researching a number of hubs I chose this one and it is great.

I am not good at the technical workings of a computer, so I was worried that the installation would be hard or that there would be conflicts with other hardware. Nothing like that happened. 

I followed the set up instructions; it took 10 minutes at most, and I was in business. Right now I have four USB devices plugged into the hub and all work just as they should. I have not had trouble with anything I added to the hub. And miraculously, I have three open ports to use later.

This hub does exactly what it should with no fuss or bother

This hub has worked exactly as anticipated.  I've had it for a month or so now and it is hooked up to my laptop.

I've got a Wireless Mouse, Epson Printer, iPod, Fuji Digital Camera all plugged into it.  It performs amazingly when syncing my iPod. I even had it unplugged from the power source and it performed without issue.

I was hesitant to purchase due to some of the reviews but it has been perfect for my needs!

I have used all of them at the same time, this hub works perfectly, and it just takes one USB port, I had one before that used two ports but this one uses only one, giving you room for another device.

I previously attempted to use this device with my Mac Pro.  I run the machine with Windows XP and Mac OS X Tiger.

With Tiger, the machine refuses to sleep when the hub is plugged into my Aluminum Cinema Display.  Simply unplug the D-Link hub, and the machine happily goes to sleep.

With Windows XP, the machine does not recognize my Microsoft Ergo Keyboard 4000 until I disconnect the keyboard from the hub, then reconnect it.  Ironically, the keyboard works fine under OS X when connected to the D-Link Hub.

I guess I got what I paid for.  A piece of junk 7 port hub for under $30.  I have reverted back to using my 2x4 Port "hockey puck" style Belkin USB 2.0 Hubs.  No problems with those

I bought this tv for use in a computer room / kid's playroom and it works nicely.  I looked at several similar models and was drawn to this one for the price and picture quality.  I do have two complaints.  My Dish Network universal remote won't operate the tv.  When I called Dish Network they said that it couldn't be programmed.  My other complaint is the sound quality.  It is really bad.  I ended up buying some Bose computer speakers and they plugged right in.  A VAST improvement.  Overall, I am pleased with this purchase

I am a dentist who uses these monitors as tv's for my patients to view while having dental procedure done.  I have been very happy with them.  There is a headphone jack, which I use for patients who don't want to hear the drilling.  I've only had them for about a month, but so far they have been great.

Guess you can sometimes pick a good one over hundreds of bad ones...   I might say I was lucky.... or for the price this litte LCD is worth the price paid...
This LCD is filling 2 pairs of shoes very nicely...   It's used as a Kitchen TV and used as a computer monitor..  Very satisfied with the TV picture.. Very clear and sharp.. Great picture.. good back lighting, not dull or dim as some other LCD's I've seen...   Sound is OK but a little thin for my liking so I added some cheap amplified speakers which really helps..    Great as a computer monitor also..  Just as clear and functional as my high end HP monitor.. refreshes at 60HZ with no issues....  Would I buy again.. or another...  perhaps but I would test it out before the purchase if at all possible... as there are some bad apples in every bunch..  Overall my purchase of this LCD TV was a complete success for my needs..

I have no clue what this little thing is about. Dummy me thought I bought a nice little tv, but it reminds me of those little cards you'd get with chewing gum and every time you moved it in your hand, the image changed. That's what you experience when you move around in the room and still want to follow a show. You cannot watch this thing with somebody else seated, say, 15 feet away from you. The other person (or you) gets a foggy image, or just dark shapes. Up close you see hardly anything.
Buyers beware: this is not a working tv.
One star for the batteries in the remote...

At my house, during rain storms, there will often be a quick flash of the lights as a branch somewhere falls on the power lines.  That type of event would always cause my PC to turn off, and I could loose quite a bit of work or even problems on the hard drive.  This little device has keept that from happening for some time.  I am very pleased.  The battery that is in it does not keep the best "time" estimates for battery life, but knowing that the short spikes or loss of power will not cause me issues makes it worth the price

This is a great product.  I bought it after losing my old computer to intermittent power one more time than I was able to revive the PC.  The new APC BE500R Back UPS has work flawlessly since I installed it several weeks ago, and has already intervened for 3 power losses and 19 instances of noisy power.  The APC control panel says I have 45 minutes of Estimated Battery Time with my Compaq Presario and 19" flat panel monitor.  I think I will get another BE500R for my television and VCRs...

I bought this thing because I lost a memory mod to a power surge.  It worked fine at first but now it has no battery life.  Recently the power went out and my computer shut off immediately - like it was not on a backup at all.  Of course the alarm was still screaming but so what - my computer was already shut off without any warning.  I had this thing for two years but I will be going with a different brand next time

First of all why do you want a power UPS? There are some very good reasons. (1) You never want your machine to go down incorrectly because of a blackout. (2) You want to work with clean power only. (3) You want to monitor your PC power. (4) You want to prevent your PC from being damaged due to a power problem like a lighting strike and want surge protection. The first rule about UPS is to never trust the insurance claim. Get your PC insured elsewhere. These companies have a tendency not to support their insurance claims. I have a PC running some very high specifications with over six USB devices, LCD monitor, printer and Ethernet equipment, with everything on at the same time. I have never gone above 325W of usage and average between 250W and 300W when managing a high spec game and doing lots of background tasks. Even though I have a 400W Power Supply Unit (PSU) I will be upgrading to a 500W PSU because it is better quality model. The way I can monitor how many Watts I use is with UPS software and hardware. So the question you need to ask is how many watts you will be using. The short answer to this is you don't know until you install the UPS and software that tells you how many watts you use because that appears to be the only way you can monitor your wattage at this time. You need to estimate what it is. I would say a high-end domestic PC (not a server) would use 300W max if it has one of every device you can think off turned on. As soon as we add things like another PC, or several printers, or several monitors, then we can start to overload a 325W UPS. This brings us to the first thing we need to learn about any UPS - Overloading and balancing. The overload feature is a warning system that turns on when you have overloaded the UPS capacity. Overloading does two things. It can in theory eventually damage the UPS and it voids the warranty. Most UPS are 325W but there are 800W - 1000W and even greater models out there for home networks that use more than one PC setup but to be honest you are probably going to get a UPS per PC setup rather than expensive bigger UPS for a network. So check the UPS rating. What UPS you choose depends on how much you want to load on it. Next thing you need to check with the UPS is if it comes with a USB connection. If it does this is a big plus because it means you can control it from your PC and the UPS comes with software. Now if the UPS has this feature then you can do loads of stuff like turning off UPS sound alarms, controlling how your UPS handles a blackout, how long it uses the battery before shutdown or hibernation, if it sounds an alarm or not, if it run self tests, data collection and monitoring, notifications and sensitivity settings. If the UPS does not come with a USB connection and software then you probably should be looking for an UPS designed for computer use rather than a UPS for non-computer equipment. Most UPS have LED indicators that tell you the status of the unit. The next thing to understand is that testing your UPS is not done by breaking it out of the box, connecting it to the mains, plugging your PC in and then turning off the house's power with the circuit breaker. You must charge the UPS first! So read the instructions. Usually you must attach the battery to the UPS (plug it in firmly!) and wait before using it. Then perform the test using the software first! Then you can consider trying to simulate a blackout in your home to see if the PC stays up. Usually a UPS is programmed to shutdown your PC if the blackout lasts for a few seconds. Nearly all UPS models with a USB connection can be customized for the shutdown event or how long the PC should hold for on the UPS battery. Most UPS devices allow you to connect a modem phone line into the device and then run a phone line into your modem. This is important because power surges on a UPS that do not have this protection can damage a PC through the unprotected phone line running into the modem that usually runs to the PC somehow. This is nasty problem with the degree of security that a UPS can provide. If it doesn't have this function then it is not going to provide 100% surge protection with a PC that is on-line. Networking a UPS PC to another PC without UPS can also increase the risk of surge protection problems. It is not recommend that you network a UPS PC to a non-UPS PC unless surge protection and the warranty are not an issue. One last thing is that some UPS have input regions on the UPS for surge protection and other input regions are not surge protected. Also with some models the batteries need to be replaced after a few years if you end up using them a lot. This is everything you need to know about an UPS before you choose one. It is basically now about downloading the technical specs of the UPS and making sure it provides you with what you need. The two top brands are APC and Belkin

After losing a computer to a power surge, I purchased the APC BE500R Back-UPS for my new computer.  I am runninig a 3.2Ghz Tower PC with a 17" LCD Monitor, I have approx. 15 minutes of Battery Runtime on my system, & the software that is very easy to install & manage, saves any open programs that I am running & safely shuts down my computer when the battery gets to within 5 minutes of running out of power if I am away from it.  Money Well Spent!  You don't need to spend a fortune on Larger units unless you want a longer runtime on Battery

I have been using 3 - 128mb, 1 -256mb, and 1 -8mb card with my 2.1 megapixel camera.  That got me about 648 photos which has been great for vacations, etc.  With the purchase of a new 7 megapixel camera, I found that my photo storage dropped to about 202 photos which was definitely not enough.  With the 2gb card, I can take a minimum of 650 photos without changing cards.  With my existing cards, that totals at about 850 photos.  That number goes up if I use my macro or supermacro settings (they drop the image size to the medium setting).  I have had no problems with any of my compact flash cards (all of them being sandisk), all have worked consistently and without issue

How many pictures will it store?  It is the most commonly asked question from digital camera enthusiast but usually the question that is the most difficult to get a straight answer about.  Well, considering I worked in the memory industry for over 7 years I can help clarify this perplexing question and do so unbiased as I have since changed industries.  

The Sandisk 2GB Compactflash Card Type I, like most 2000MB cards, will store on average 2275 pictures when used with a 2 megapixel camera, 1706 images when used with a 3 megapixel camera,  1024 pictures when used with a 4 megapixel camera, 819 images when used with a 5 megapixel camera, and 640 pictures when used with a 6 megapixel camera.  These numbers are based off the assumption that you are going to shoot your images at the highest quality JPEG setting available for the camera and understand that they are estimates and may be off by as much as 10 percent due to numerous factors including the complexity of the scene being shot and the compression algorithm used by your specific camera.

One last thing to consider when buying a 2000MB card.  Do not necessarily choose the least expensive card available.  A 2000MB card should be an investment.  You need to consider quality, reliability, and speed with a card of this capacity.  Worse case scenario would be you taking this card (and only this card) on vacation with you overseas and for some reason it gets corrupted.  Then what do you do?  Purchasing a high capacity card changes the game a little, just be mindful of that before you hit the buy button.

I truly hope this review was helpful to you in determining whether this card is the right capacity for your specific needs

I have had this CF card for nearly a year (A year ago, it cost nearly $300--boy those CF memory prices have dropped!) and it has worked without incident where I use it for MP3/WMA storage on my iPAQ PDA. It does not appear to cause a significant power drain on my iPAQ battery, so it must be a fairly efficient chip. The write speed of this chip is roughly 40% slower than a Sandisk Ultra II CF, which is preferrable for digital cameras. For reliable storage and backup applications though, this 2GB CF is now an excellent value

.............Is not functional................ .
If you are reading this then you are Gump-y! And, you and I must be family. 
First, I love Amazon; they are the consistent type of e-merchant.  And that's good! But but but but, why?:  would a designated (by me) upper "echelon" merchant like Amazon carry this Sandisk 2gb compact flash card type I (sdcfb-2048-768). It simply is not functional information that I stored Sandisk 2GB compact flash card type I (sdcfb-2048-768) is gone, or not readable. I am surprised that Amazon did not catch-on/up with the problem. 
The product won't retain any info then I had to store less and less information on the card, so that my info is able to stay on the card another 6 hours. I decided to contact Amazon, they were very shortly, and cordially sent me a replacement Sandisk 2gb compact flash card type I (sdcfb-2048-768), with the paperwork for returning the original Sandisk 2gb compact flash card type I (sdcfb-2048-768). 
Then I got something that: 
A.	Did, have the shape of a 2gig Sandisk CF card; 
B.	Did, have the Sandisk label that says Sandisk 2GB compact flash card type I (sdcfb-2048-768)......; 
C.	And did have the original shiny factory Sandisk package. None-being the-less 3 different computers later and 2 hour had passed couldn't recognize what is inserted into the CF reader. 
D.	The brand new replacement card I got with the original factory wrapping, that's brand new and untouched and unrecognized by computers. One may safely assume (pardon the facetiousness), Sandisk 2GB compact flash card type I (sdcfb-2048-768), is yet to be recognized. 

From Amazon, twice in the mail, I got a Sandisk 2 GB compact which flash card type I (sdcfb-2048-768). Both cards I received had a problem. And therefore, it is safe to assume that Sandisk 2GB compact flash card type I (sdcfb-2048-768) production have a major glitch. I mean, the memory card cannot be used for memory purposes. I have to yet see what or for what, other than memory, can I utilize a memory card. I beg your pardon, but in essence I am trying to imply that... The Sandisk products were a joke! :-). 
Being the consistent e-merchant that Amazon always been, Amazon agreed to return them. This was not a surprise (coming from Amazon). 
In essence, I strongly urge any person that makes a living, and tries to have some fun with their hard earned living to:
1.	Not be fooled. If you see Sandisk, run away as fast as possible, 
2.	You'll lose it all in a matter of a day or so. 
3.	Sandisk 2GB compact flash card type I (sdcfb-2048-768) is not compatible with data storage! or even short transfers of data, from a home computer to work.
4.	Spend the extra.... on an alternative brand. 
5.	That's the only way you'll get a CF card that is correctly labeled; and, serve intended functions. 
6.	I strongly recommend, as well as urge individual who is thinking of  getting that "other" brand of 2-giga...... cards to make sure do so:................
7.	Use Amazon only, and don't be fooled by any other e-merchant who's not as high of an echelon as Amazon....... Amazon! 
8.	Had it not been for Amazon, I would have lost all I paid. :).

God bless Amazon for their extreme timely tentativeness, I also pray for Sandisk, so that god renders it with the power to accomplish the purpose they stick onto their product line.
God bless, and keep on shopping.

I have been trying to find a way to easily carry a lot of camera equipment for quite some time. I have tried backpacks, shoulder bags, duffel bags, but none of them really worked all that well. Then I saw the Lowepro Street and Field system with completely customizable pouches, vests, belts, and accessories. It works great, you only get the pouches you need so there is no waisted space and you can organize them however you want according to how often they are used (put frequently used items in easier to access places.) 

The variety alone of this system is worth the investment, but the quality and ease of use is also very high which is a big plus. You can get a case for any lens, camera body, or accessory you have. I even have cases for my cell phone and water bottle. One word of caution, be sure to measure your lens with the lens hood on backwards if you use them to make sure that the entire thing will fit into the pouch, because sometimes the lens will fit, but then the lens with the lens hood will not. I often carry 5-6 lenses, extension tubes, teleconverters, extra memory cards and batteries, and a bunch of cleaning supplies and other gadgets, which weights a ton. But when they are evenly distributed on this vest/belt Lowepro system it is actually very manageable. 

The only down side is that everyone will be staring at you because you have thousands of dollars of camera equipment strapped to your body. But if you can overlook that, this is the way to go. I have used this system at many zoos without ever having problems, in fact just unzipping a single lens and switching seems safer to me than opening an entire bag of equipment every time you want to switch lenses. Many of the cases also come with a built in rain/snow cover so if the weather changes all of your equipment is not destroyed. You can also put just a few pouches on a normal belt when you are just going to take photos in the back yard or don't need to take all of your equipment, which is nice. I really can't say enough about how much easier this makes traveling with a lot of equipment, if you have been hopelessly searching for a better solution, consider this, you won't regret it.

I have had excellent results transferring my VHS Tapes(movies, etc.)to Memorex DVD+R/RW discs. I have a Philips DVDR985 DVD Recorder/Player and it will only record on DVD+R/RW discs. I have been through several other manufacturers +R/RW discs and none were as reliable as Memorex(and, of course Philips). I ran into a problem recording on the +R disc, however, that was due to a problem with the Recorder. I just bought another 50 DVD+RW Memorex discs(2-25 disc spindles) and when they run out I will still go for Memorex.

Very unreliable .......... I have used DVD RW and CD RW Memorex disks on multiple computers and DVD recorders.  I find that they.....1) don't last....get about 50 re-recordings NOT 1500  2) may crap out on any occasion.......multiple CD RW's with critical material would NOT read on multiple computers.

I bought one of these a year ago, and have really liked the fact that the spaces will hold up to 5 dvd cases, so I can store sets as well as individual disks.  Also, I don't use this as a carrying case, so I have had no problem with anything coming apart.  In fact, I like it so well I have just ordered another one

The main reason I bought this kit was for the label applicator, the software was secondary. Good thing that I didn't care about how good the software would be, because the software for this is, in a word, deplorable.

It doesn't have support for ANY other label sheets other than the memorex brand, which leaves you stuck with their labels. Its got some nice features in the software, but their poorly implemented. For instance, it can automatically resize an image to fit a CD/DVD, but if you've rotated it before that, the rotation is lost. It has a lot of minor quirks like that, and they add up to an annoyance to use this.

If you get this product, find a better labelling program to go with the label sheets and the applicator

I recently purchased this labelmaker system for use on my iMac, and have had no problems at all. I printed out my CD labels on an Epson CX5200. The quality of the printouts isn't as clear as I'd like (most likely due to the quality of the paper), but it's not bad for a home system that cost under $20. It's easy, quick, and has lots of cool graphics

The labels are sticky on one side, and printable on the other, but that's about all this product has going for it.  The software is a nightmare.  The print previews only vaguely represent the finished product, and the program frequently and randomly alters your image.  I wound up using the labels, but creating the documents in MS publisher.  what a shame

First of all, despite the claim that it works with MacIntosh, it definately does not.  There is a template that you can use in Mac with Word, Claris, and other photoshop software, but there are no instructions as to how.  Once you think you have it figured out (on the page) it doesn't print the same as pictured.  The technial support people have no idea how to make it work with Mac, and will probably tell you it is a problem with your printer drivers.  In any case, they have no idea how to direct you through the process of using the Word template for MacIntosh.  Don't waste your money. (I gave it one star only because no stars is not an option.

Okay,

This is not a review of the product itself. But, I strongly
encourage you to consider not getting an N.E.W warranty. They are
really not in the business to fix things but to make money not fixing things. 

If you had anything to do with the device not working (e.g. you dropped it, forget about it they aint gonna fix/replace it whatever.) 

They have a very sparce network of repair companies so if there is no one who can fix it in your area you have to ship it to them in Virginia(of course you have to pay for the shipping!)

Lastly, they tend to screw over their repair companies so in some cases they will refuse to repair items covered under an N.E.W warranty or they will take forever to repair it since they know N.E.W will take months to pay them for the work they did.

If you want a nightmare for a warranty then by all means go for it

I purchased this flash card to take on vacation so that I would have enough room for all of the pictures I planned to take.  I had no problems at all with the card, with the images it produced, or any transfers.  I used the card in a Nikon 8800, and now use it as my primary memory.  I recommend this card to anyone for its high quality, and low price.  It is a good value

I bought this card from Dell
I worried once because some complain it don't work
then I learned the card supports FAT32 ONLY, then I did a test on my pda (HP HX2415), format the existing card to FAT32, found the pda supports, and bought
I found the card works perfectly with my pdas (HP HX2415 and Dell Axim X50v), no problem so far
MUST READ:
before buying this 4GB card, you need to do a file system compatibility test
you need to save the card's content onto host, then format the card to FAT32 format, then put the card into the device
if the device can use the card right away without formatting, you'll be fil

Beware of KINGSTON rebates!

Of course, I hope your experience would differ, if you were to buy Kingston product(s), but mine was terrible.

I bought a Kingston CompactFlash card that offered a $50 mail-in rebate.  I promptly (as in, the day AFTER I received the item delivery) went to photocopy my rebate certificate and UPC code and sales receipt; then sent it all on its merry way.  Yes, I was well within the rebate period, both for the purchase AND for the postmark date.  My purchase was a valid retailer (think HUGE online e-tailer).

The rebate REQUIRED sending THE ENTIRE ORIGINAL UPC label, which was like the entire outside package for my CF card, about the size of 1  business cards when flattened.  No problem.

About TWO MONTHS later, I get a letter saying "your rebate request was denied because you failed to furnish the appropriate ORIGINAL UPC code as required by the rebate offer."

Well, now  WHAT?  I can't RE-SEND the original (it was already in their possession).  I called, and they insisted on repeating what the letter said.  I re-sent my PHOTOCOPIES and they said a photocopy is invalid proof of purchase.

After another 6 weeks of pursuing this, I figured this is their scam.  They simply wouldn't honor the rebate.  And without the ORIGINAL UPC in my possession, I couldn't really submit to their requirements.

If you're looking for a RAM upgrade, I'd suggest you look at a quality company like OCZ (the BEST!), or Patriot, Geil, or Corsair.  If you're looking for a value Flash Memory Card, I might suggest SanDisk.

For one, Kingston does NOT make the best products, they are VALUE-driven products.

Two, there are competitors to Kingston with just as good or better value-to-performance ratios at the same prices.

Three, Kingston will not stand behind their customer as I have experienced.

I urge you to, please, be cautious of Kingston and their rebate scams

I'm not sure what I expected after I purchased this for fifty some-odd dollars and was handed a coupon for a $40 rebate.  But I wish that someone had informed me before I lugged it all the way home that when you sing into the mic, your voice doesn't come through the speaker.  I'm cool with the machine's sound quality when it comes to playing a CD-G.  If I tap the mic, I can hear an extremely faint thud, so I know it's on, but the volume's too low--and, yes, I adjusted the mic controls--if you want to sing along. Which makes this a dinosaur: a boom box in the age of the iPod.  

Really had to dig through the stacks of machines to find a box that hadn't been opened.  So, when was my first clue?  Doh

My review mirrors of this product mirrors that of another customer posted recently.  For some months after I first bought the card, it worked great.  Now it has twice caused memroy card errors and corrupted data with my Canon Elph, and photo technicians have been unable to retrieve any of the pictures from the card.  Judging by what other customers have written, I'm suspecting that this may be an issue of poor compatibility between Canon cameras and Viking cards.  In any case, I will be buying a new memory card and it will certainly not be a Viking

I have had a Canon G2 since 2002. I used to use Viking 128 MB CF cards and had no problem. In October 2004, I bought one Viking CF512M 512MB CF card from Amazon. I did not use it until this summer. After I had taken 20 more photos and reviewed, I immediately found a few images corrupted. No matter how I tried, e.g. format the CF before use, there were alway corrupted images.

I wonder if I can return the defect CF card and get a replacement from Amazon or from manufacturer?

I used to like my Viking 512MB CF card a lot.  I had such a card for more than a year.  In that period, I used it in my camera.  It's filled up for several times.  Also occationally I use a card reader (SimpleTech) to write/read that card, to transfer some big files between computers.  It's all fine, and suddenly one day, when the card was half full, and after a card reader reading, I got "CF card error" on my camera.  Fortunately, after I delete a few pictures, I could move on.  I gave the card to  other people, so I don't know how it's doing now.

After that, I purchased another Viking 512MB, half year ago.  I used it to transfer files for a few times, and have never filled it up using my camera yet.  Now I am getting consistent "CF card error" message on my camera, even after re-format for several times, while I don't have that problem if I use another card.  

One theory I heard was that a card reader may damage a card.  I can not verify though.  Anyway, I will have to buy another card now, and it won't be viking for this time.

===== One month later =====
I contacted with their customer support.  They gave me a number for return, and I mailed back my damaged CF card.  They sent back a new one in a week.  The new one is working fine so far.  The exchange was not difficult.  They did not ask for ridiculous things like my old receipt.  They only verified the serial number.  That's good

I don't know what those other reviewers are talking about when they write that the price is outrageous, but if you are looking for a solution that includes the dock, power brick, and cables than this will save you about $5 - $10. I don't know about the retail price being $99 as listed here, but from what I've been able to find, this is an OK deal for what it includes

$99.99 list price?  Over $70 actual price?  You've got to be kidding!  I never accuse companies of raping consumers, because we are free to choose what we buy and how much we spend, but this smells of taking advantage of consumer ignorance.  If you want to connect your iPod to your home stereo, get a $7.00 "stereo mini-plug to RCA plug Y-adapter" at Radio Shack.  That's all you need.  Because you already have a recharger (it came with your iPod), the only additional capability this kit provides is holding your iPod upright. I have this item (it came free with my 40GB iPod) and, although it offers a slight convenience over not having it, the price is a terrible rip-off.

This is basically a 1/8" male to RCA cable for $73; you could get the same exact cable for $5.99 at Radio Shack.  Yeah you get a dock and power brick too but price it out; not worth it.  Buy the cable at RS; it'll work EXACTLY the same.. don't be fooled.  If you want the dock and power brick buy them seperately; you'll save major $$$..

This stereo connector is fabulous.  I already had a very good Kenwood stereo system with great speakers.  Now I can play any of the 10,000 songs from my IPOD through my stereo.  The wires from this kit just plug into the back of the receiver in an open slot, I use the "Video 2" slot on my receiver.  The connecting wire goes into the IPOD cradle.  Then simply put the IPOD in the cradle, select Video 2 on the receiver and ta-da all of my music at my fingertips without getting out hundreds of CDs.  Also, because the IPOD will shuffle, now my stereo shuffles too, either through all of my music or through any genre.  Finally not only does it play the songs but it also charges the IPOD as well. This is absolutely the best accessory I've purchased for my IPOD.  It's well worth the investment

1 3-foot cable to connect power supply brick and dock

1 3-foot cable to connect dock and stereo

This version of the kit is compatible with 3rd and 4th generation iPods (those with a dock connector on the bottom) and with the iPod mini. Although the dock connector is electronically the same for all these iPods, the dimensions of the iPod itself differ by model. Thus, the dock comes with different plastic tops for the different sizes of iPods and you snap on the right-sized top for your iPod (check the size carefully before snapping on the cover - it goes on easily, but it doesn't come off easily).

The cable that connects the power supply brick and the dock is a special Apple firewire-to-iPod-dock cable, but the cable that connects the iPod and the stereo system is nothing special, just a standard stereo minijack plug on one end and two rca phono plugs on the other. You can get a compatible cable from many different vendors and in many different lengths; which in my case was a good thing because the 3-foot length in the kit was too short.

Is the kit a good buy? Well, it depends. If you price all of the components in the kit separately, you will find that the kit is cheaper than the individual parts, even if you have to replace the stereo cable as I did. But, the question is, do you need to buy all the parts. Let's assume for the moment that you do in fact want to attach your iPod to your stereo and consider what you might be able to do without:

(1) Power supply brick. Your iPod and dock will in fact work fine without being plugged into the power supply. The trade-off is that without it you will drain the battery of the iPod while it is plugged into your stereo. You can get a dock and a stereo cable for substantially less than this kit, so if you're OK with the battery issue, you can save money by not getting the kit.

(2) iPod dock. You can plug the iPod into the stereo without the dock. The same stereo cable that connects the dock to the stero will also connect the iPod to the stereo. There are two disadvantages to this: first, the dock gives a true line-out, meaning that the volume control on the iPod doesn't affect the volume coming out of the dock, so you just use the stereo's volume control to control the playback volume. The audio-out jack on the iPod, however, is affected by the iPod's volume control, so if you connect it to the stereo, you have to be careful about the fact that there are two volume controls in the system, which is annoying at best, and there might be some risk to your stereo if the iPod's volume is too high. It is also worth noting if you have a power supply brick, you do not need the dock to recharge your iPod - the brick can plug into the iPod directly. If you are OK with the audio-out thing (and whether and how to keep your iPod upright without it) you can save money by not getting the kit and doing without the dock.

(3) Power-supply brick to dock cable. If you don't have the brick, you don't need the cable; if you do have the brick, you need the cable or the brick isn't going to do you any good. If you have decided you can do without recharging the iPod while it is connected to your stereo, you can skip the brick and this cable both.

(4) Dock-to-Stereo cable. This is the thing you can't do without if you want to connect your iPod and your stereo, but you have a lot of choices on vendors if this is all you're getting. Even if you aren't getting a dock, the cable that would connect the dock to the stereo is the same one that would connect the iPod to the stereo directly.

One more thing to consider is that your iPod might have already come with one or more of these pieces, and if you aren't using them elsewhere, you could use them as part of your stereo set-up and just buy any other pieces you need and not get the whole kit.

For me, I didn't have any extra pieces and I wanted the works - to recharge  the iPod and not have to worry about a double volume control, so I got the kit. I also got the NaviPod IR Remote (which you can get right here at Amazon) so that I could control it remotely like the rest of my stereo gear.

To make your decision, just figure out what you want to have, what pieces you have already, and what you might be willing to live without and then make your decision. Hope this was helpful

100 cds is a lot of cds (though you'd be surprised how many it takes to back up a PC. Uh, when DID you last back up YOUR data?) 

You can put pictures, files, music on these cds. We use them just for data backup, and use Fellowes software and labels to make custom labels with contents. These are filed in an album and it's easy to reload or retrieve data in this manner. We have not had any problem writing or reading these cds

I do all my burning on a standard Windows Media player, and it's almost entirely data and music, no video. For my purposes, these CD's sound great. In some cases, it actually seems like the discs have enhanced the sound spectrum somewhat. That may be a trick my ears are playing on me but, nevertheless, I'm a big fan of the Memorex. And they're a steal if you catch the sale price. Recommended

As a person who has used lots of writable CD and DVD products I would highly recommend this product. I have yet to have any problems of any kind while using this product. If your storage needs are under 650 + megabytes I would buy this product. Note : This product needs several Megabytes of room for formatting and does not hold exactly 700 Merabytes of your data. For the price listed this ad it is a great deal as well..

At less than a dollar per sparkly Frisbee, this is the best price I can find for Frisbees. They don't fly very well and they break relatively easily, but this is the best value I can find for 100 Frisbees in one place.

A lot of people are disappointed because they expect to be able to use these discs as writable CD media. The problem with that is, they don't work very well for that either. I, too, tested this for myself.

Using Nero Burning ROM, I tried many times to burn different kinds of data onto several of the discs -=AT 4X=-, just like you're supposed to. IT WORKED! It burned fine. Then it took 5 minutes to open a simple HTML document on the burned disc. Subsequent trials run with the "Verify Written Data" checkbox checked revealed that every other sector or so was unreadable after burning. It's like writing with a white crayon, except this is white paper. This persisted on several OTHER computers with different CD burner drives and even different software.

I finally realized what great Frisbees these things are. Cheer up people: THEY ARE GREAT FUN! So grab your spindle, go outside, and start chucking these things at your neighbor's annoying dog.

PS. I need to sue Memorex for selling this junk. These disc are just a form of abuse

When I buy flash memory, I consider price, speed, manufacturer and vendor. I got this particular memory stick for a SonyEricsson w810i phone. I paid extra to get it from Amazon (no they don't always have the best price). This way I am confident that I can return it if I got the wrong one or have a problem with it.

The card works fine in my phone, and since I have a USB cable that hooks up to the phone, I don't have to be concerned about removing the card to use a card reader. I have not yet experienced any problems with Sandisk memory products.

I am told that the Sandisk sticks are faster than Sony's, but I have no way to confirm this, nor do I know if my phone (mp3 player, camera) is able to take advantage of faster speeds. The longest process is transferring music to the phone, and I wasn't in a hurry anyway.

This stick comes with an adapter to use with the older memory stick format, so I can use the 128mb stick that I replaced in my Sony Camcorder (which had a 4mb stick in it. No, it's not a typo. It's actually a 4 megabyte memory stick)

I have a Sony Cybershot DSCP-100, I love the camera and use it for taking SCUBA Diving pictures.  I bought this memorystick duo to use for that purpose, I can take up to 45 minutes of video or close to 400 pictures on highest quality setting.  The memorystick comes with an adapter so you can use it in full size memory stick applications as I do in the camera, or you can use this without the adapter for PSP, and PDA or cell phones!  The price couldn't be beat anywhere else and I received the shipment within a week at my FPO mailbox on base here in Japan.  If you want a great deal pick one up, I may even buy one more for when I travel so I don't have to take my laptop with me to download and reformat the card, at this price I can afford it

I bought these to use with my Samsung Z5 mp3 player.  While the packaged earbuds were good, the sound was just drowning in bass.  I like good bass, but not when it completely overpowers everything else.  I had given the Sony 51's a try and promptly returned them; they sounded ok, but kind of made my ears hurt, and for $40, they weren't worth it.  I had read some reviews on these 828's, so I decided to go with these.  The sound is incredible.  The bass is well defined, but is balanced nicely with the midrange and treble.  I was literally hearing nuances in the music that I didn't with other buds.  They fit very well (though any earbuds will start to feel uncomfortable after a period of extended use, which is discouraged anyway).  A set of black foam earbud pads is included.  I always prefer to use the pads, but it is of course your own call whether or not you use them.  The pads will wear out, but you can buy exact replacements at Radio Shack (pack of 4 for $4) that fit perfectly.  Personally, I usually end up replacing the pads every few months or so.

My only gripe about the 828's (and the only reason for 4 instead of 5 stars) is that the cord is too short for my taste.  About another foot or so would be nice.  Otherwise, this is a great product and at around $10 is a STEAL

I've been on the lookout for replacement earbuds for my nano and finally found these. I think they are just awesome and believe Apple should bundle these with their nano. For the price this is a steal.

With the right EQ setting on the nano, I just love these buds. Excellent Bass and with the 'Treble Booster' EQ setting in the iPod ON, these buds become perfect nearly.

Before getting these buds I bought Senn HD-202, Grado SR-60 and Koss KSC-75 and though all of these are really good for different kinds of music that I listen, none of them compliment my iPod Nano the way these buds too. With the Winding case, their style, their sound quality and an unbelivable price I think they are just the perfect buds for the nano. As for their comfort, I think they are well suited for people on the move and are as comfortable as the original apple buds.

Go get these and soon you'll be getting another pair

I had a pair of earbuds that came with my Creative mp3 player last September that I really liked, but for whatever reason the cord length was different between the left and right earbud. Either way, I tore them up on accident and decided to go with these Sonys. The bass isn't quite as strong as it was in the Creative ones, but these are solid earbuds and worth the price. The cord length is the same for both earbuds on this model and the nice little plastic winding case is handy. 

For the price, these are definitely worthy of a purchase

Just my two cents, I bought these from the sony store for $15 bucks two years ago, they've lasted me this long for light office use, so at $7/year, this seems to be a good budget earphones.  I'm not an audiophile, so I don't need expensive earphones.  However they did eventually die on me where the cable connects to the jack, the wires got loose and the sound just stopped.  Moral of the story: don't twist or touch the wires/cable.

Pros:  lightweight, budget-oriented, comfortable fit for my ears
Cons:  eventually broke, cheap earphone covers will get lost easil

I have had an iPod mini for over a year now and everyone knows iPods come with the classic white Apple earbuds. Well, one day, I missplaced my Apple earbuds and borrowed my dad's earbuds (the Sony ones on this page). I needed to borrow them 'cause I was getting dragged to my little sister's softball tournament which was pretty far away. The catch here? My dad drives a huge diesel truck. The NOISY ones. So we all got into the truck and I tried out the headphones and I was just blown away. I could actually HEAR my music. Unlike the Apple ones, these were quiet and comfortable, actually shaped like an ear. They even come with a cool case and little plushy things. The only bad thing about the little black plush things is they slip off the earbuds very easily and will eventually disspear. It's a pity too, they were very comfy. But even without the plushies, the earbuds were still comfy.
Basically, I highly recommend these lovely, lovely little earbuds

I bought this mouse a couple months ago to use with my MacBook Pro.  I loved it, until a couple days ago when it decided to stop working.  It's not connecting to the USB adapter any more.  I changed the battery and tried the Connect button, and nothing.  Sad, isn't it

I received a previous version of this mouse as a promotional gift from Microsoft, and since have not been able to separate myself from it whenever I travel.  It is the most "plug and play" piece of hardware I have ever purchased for a pc (noteboook or otherwise) -- no software installation or complicated setup necessary.  It of course does not have the bells and whistles that the Logitech Revolution series mice have (ie. tilt wheel/side to side scrolling, customizable buttons, and easily-accessible forward/back buttons for fast and efficient web browsing), but for basic functionality, this mouse simply cannot be beaten.  As a travel companion, it is extraordinarily lightweight and low maintenance -- with its snap-in receiver, there are no worries of ever leaving for a business trip with unnecessary weight or having to account for multiple devices/attachments just to make offsite work more tolerable (ie. why bring a mouse when just using the laptop's touchpad was a better option than having to worry about one more thing to keep track of?).  This mouse, however, has me spoiled -- I even use it while working on my laptop at home, sitting on my couch (the optical laser even works quite well on the surface of a leather couch!).  The soft-touch buttons and scroll wheel are also amazingly easy on the hand when doing a ton of repetitive movements.  One thing of importance to note, however, is that the version I got from Amazon does *not* have the same adjustable receiver that my promotional version has.  While the receiver still easily and conveniently snaps into the bottom of the mouse, it sticks out quite a bit more than the adjustable version does, and resultingly would also not work as well with notebooks that have a vertical (as opposed to horizontal) USB port.  Nevertheless, this is such a great mouse I felt compelled to have more than just one

I bought this mouse about 14 months back!!! And it's been working great! 

Pros:
===========
1. Nice design
2. good looks
3. ergonomic
4. I use it almost 14 hours a day, and need to charge/replace the battery like once in a month
5. good range: i did not need to buy a RC because of this.
6. light weight/small
7. Can rotate the USB transmitter by 90 deg, hence will work even if you have vertical USB slots on your laptop.


Cons:
==========
1. would have liked it more if it had an internal battery and some way of charging it through the USB connection. I use a rechargeable battery, and need to charge it monthly.

This is a great mouse. The size is perfect because it isn't too big or too small. Also, the battery lasts forever. I've had the mouse for over a year, I  use it every day and I still haven't replaced the battery. I liked it so much that I got one for my Mom when she got a laptop. She's a flight attendant so she travels all the time and she really likes the mouse too. Good portability and functionability

I'm a Mac user (OS 10.4) so I particularly like that this reader doesn't require a separate driver. Cards mount on my desktop as any drive would, and the software that came with my Canon Powershot G6 senses the card automatically. 

I have had no trouble with the cover hinge as another reviewer mentioned. I love the fact that it's small and lightweight and fits into a tiny pocket on my camera case so I never lose track of it. 

The LED lets you know when files are being transferred and when it's safe to disconnect the device.

Overall, it's inexpensive, fast and easy-to-use ~ a great value

Quick reader, poor design. It does a great job copying images to my Mac, but the flimsy lid is a piece of poo-poo. It stays on tight, which is good, until you try to open it. The force required to open it pulls the lid completely off making the ball-groove hinges useless. It's only a matter of time until the weak arms containing the hinges snap off, leaving the reader exposed to the elements

This little reader is fast and as easy to use as a USB flash drive. Pop in your card, plug it in, and wahlah, all your files are shown. Transfers are very fast and easy. It uses a standard USB cable, so it's likely you could use the same cable for a variety of devices (MP3 player, camera, cell phone)

The device is somewhat flimsy, however and the front always snaps off when you try to open the unit rather than working like a hinge, as it should. This is somewhat annoying to have to reattach the hinge everytime, so it gets 4 stars. Still a very good buy, especially for the price

This reader is very fast - compared to my usb1 and non-cardbus pcmcia compact flash readers this one is about 4x (or more) as fast.  It is small and compact, the only thing I don't like is the required USB cable (though it is included) instead of a built in USB plug - just one more thing to bring with my laptop

I was so impressed with the amount of memory on this media card. I wondered if I could take a movie of my son's 3 minute song at his school band concert. I probably had at least a dozen or more pictures at the highest quality on the card already so was so surprised that I had 23 minutes of movie memory available! What a price to pay for peace of mind

This card is the largest size that will allow clean video with FinePix cameras from 2004 or earlier.  The picture-to-picture lag time is minimal with this card and video is excellent. 

From Fuji Website - "NOTE: for owners of FinePix cameras made before 2004, check notice below for the operating compatibility of older FinePix cameras with Type M and H.

I've had this printer for about 3 months. I do a good amount of printing and still have nearly half the catridges left (I've only printed papers and images that came out great.. never tried photos yet, but I wouldn't be surprised if they come out decent)! Not to mention there are only 2 catridges (compared to 4 on my old epson!), that are a decent price compared to other brands. It rarely jams, but you should keep an eye on it.. nothing too extreme. It's small, lightweight and prints from the last page to the first so it's all in order once it's finished printing. I bought this new on amazon for around 30 dollars and would say it was the best purchase I could have made... (better than my old epson i spent 200 on that guzzled ink after two photos and died after a year!

Being a graduate student and living in an apartment, I was hoping to find a cheap printer that would allow me to print off course materials and assignments.  It prints off things quite well and it is fast.  It does not, however, print 500 pages per month.  50-100 pages per month is a more reasonable estimate and then the cartridges cost over $20, which is high considering how often you need to buy them.

The item did arrive in a timely fashion and it arrived in the specified condition.

I detest this printer.  I've bought quite a few printers in my day:  Lexmark, Canon, and have been quite happy with most HP's, but this was the pits.  The first one I brought home worked fine the first time but when I tried to turn it on the next day, it wouldn't cut on.  It just died on me.  I unplugged it, plugged it back it...then it worked for a little while before dying again.  This time for good.  I returned it, got another one...same problem.  Except this time it keeps going.  All I have to do is unplug it before each and every time I turn it on.  Nice, huh?  

Now I'm browsing online again and I've learned my lesson for sure.  No more el cheapo models.  I'm at least going to shell out for a midline price with some heft to it that will last me a year or two

I only paid $30 including shipping and taxes. The ink cartridges alone are worth that. Printer works great.

Set up easy BUT DO NOT USE THE CD PROVIDED, It loads and incredible amount B/S that you do not need-some of which is impossible to get off your computer once loaded.
Instead google a driver off the internet and download it

There are so many times we often see the musts of having a quality printer for all occasions. Although it isn't actually a bad thing, it does become a important tool for our everyday computer use. That has been the case whether you need to fax a freshly printed version of a resume, or show a graphic chart of sales for your company. Well, the folks at Hewlett-Packard know exactly what they're talking about. They've been making quality printers for all walks of life. But, with the hassle of finding a inexpensive printer for those on a strict budget, than this is your key to a quality printer at a inexpensive cost.

The Hewlett-Packard Deskjet 3930 Color Inkjet Printer is arguably, the most convient, and easy to setup printer right now on the market. It just simply hooks through your USB port, either 1.1. or 2.0, and it will print anything you need to save on paper. It is easy to operate, and runs smoothly without any messy problems. The copies it prints up are neat and near flawless on a color or a black inkjet cartridge #21 and #22. Still, there are a few disadvantages though with the printer. One of them is that it doesn't come with a standard USB cable, you'd have to buy that on your own, and the same goes with the black inkjet cartridge. Although that is a must, you can still print black and white copies for your convience with the colored inkjet cartridge #22 by itself. 

Despite a couple of add-ons you'd need to buy, The HP Deskjet 3930 is a well-certified printer for anyone who needs a good printer, without a inexpensive price. I needed this to replace a problem I had with my previous printer, and it works like a charm. I definitely recommend this printer a whole lot.

The advancements in technology never cease to amaze me.  They continue to get smaller and smaller even when you didn't think it was possible.  Such is the case for the Panasonic SD Memory card as well.  Not only is it small, but it has a large capacity for adapting to a variety of digital content types.  This SD Memory Card can write data at a rate of 10 MB per second!  I mainly use my SD Memory card to save music from my MP3 player.  I normally get about 5 1/2 hours out of the card.  I highly recommend this to anyone who uses audio, video, communications and information devices and appliances.  It is the wave of the future

When I bought my 3G 20GB iPod, this part was included.  Fortunately when I sold the iPod, I forgot to include it, because we are getting a Video today, and now I learn this item is not included.  Way to go Apple...I believe it is called fleecing your customers.  At least there is an alternative way to charge these...

Very useful item, I agree, as much as I hate paying more, I also hate burning out a high dollar piece of electronics (iPod/Cell Phone/PDA/Laptop) because some company had monkeys putting them together in a remote jungle in Indonesia or something.  

I have had too many friends lose cells in particular because of the $5 charger they found online or at the flea market

Functionally, this works fine.  Compact design, AC plug folds in for a smooth case, easy to pack, hard to damage, and since there is no cord associated with the input to the AC outlet, there is one less thing to lose or damage. There is a USB cord from the unit to the IPOD, but that is it. A little more expensive, since it has an Apple logo associated with it, but it works

Yes, Apple should include this thing -- with the higher end iPods, at least.  But they don't.

The point of this post is to remind prospective USB-Power-Adapter buyers this:  with electronics, you tend to get what you pay for.  

So, you're tempted by those three-dollar, off-brand USB adapters?  Stay away from them.  You have, probably, a couple hundred bucks tied up in your iPod(s); it doesn't make sense to cheap-out now and take a risk with shoddy, fly-by-night electronics for your iPod....the same iPod that you scrupulously protect from scratches and such.  Apple designed their USB Power Adapter to work with their iPods.  And they do work.  Very well.

Shame on Apple for fleecing us, though.  But, shame on you if you damage the electronics of your iPod by using some third-rate, flea market power adapter.

Just buy Apple's

I don't understand why people spend money on this charger, when you can pay half as much for the same thing. I bought an iPod charger for my 5G iPod video from Sonnet Technologies and I am very satisfied. It is small and the connectors retract for easy carrying around.

Search Amazon for "Sonnet USB Wall Charger for Ipod with USB-to-Dock Cable" at about HALF the price. It comes in black or white to go with the color of your iPo

I do not like this item because it says it is a 16x DVD but when I put it in my burner it only reads it as 4x.  Something is wrong with the DVDs because my burner is one of the newest out there and it is a 16x burner.  So if you are looking for 16x, do not buy this one

I've never had any problems with Memorex DVD's or CD's. When I was ordering and read some of the reviews here, I had to go back and look at what I was using to make sure. I've always taken it for granted and only posted this review to counteract some of the negative ones. I don't know why some users are having problems, but these DVD's always worked great for me, and I record on average over one a day

I record dvd movies as a hobby and am always looking for better media, software etc.- I'd been using Ridata for some time w/ next to no coasters but figured I'd upgrade and go with memorex this time around. Big mistake. They skip, pixelate and freeze up. I have had to recopy at least 5 out of the last dozen or so movies I've done. Were it a compatibility issue I could understand, but it appears to be strictly a problem with the quality of the media. I'm going back to using my cheap disks! 
The lesson here is: " If it works, dont fix it!

I agree that this drive can be a little slow, but it hasn't caused a problem for me. I keep copies of many files (about 1 GB total) related to a large project at work on mine. When I first copied all the files to the drive it took a couple of minutes, but now I just make changes or updates to the individual files and the write times are short enough that I don't even notice them (just a second or two). I also seemlessly work on the files on both a PC at work and a Mac at home. 

To me the best feature is the reliability. Between my husband and I, we've had several Cruzer Minis in various sizes and each one has worked great, even through accidental abuse. One of his 512 MB drives accidently went through the washing machine. We thought the data was gone, but when it dried out, it worked fine. Just today I found my 2 GB drive at the bottom of the dryer; it had been left in a pocket and had gone through both the washing machine and dryer. Yep, it still worked! I'm buying a new one to replace it (just in case) because I don't know it there might be some long-term effects from the water and heat, but I'll keep using this one for less important applications. Changes are good, though, that it'll never have a problem. These things are amazingly reliable

I bought this flash drive about 4 months ago, and it's worked perfectly, I use it everyday, it has a great feature for hidding important information, a password restricted area on the flash drive, it's perfect because you don't have to worry anymore when lending your flash drive about compromising your info.....

This flashdrive does its job well under normal circumstances. It works fine for transfering data between computers running Windows when network is not avail, or when large filesize is involved. Its impressively quick at uploading big files. And best of all you can take it right out of the package and use it. No fuss or setup time involved. Windows XP recognizes it in seconds.

I'm a school teacher and use the cruzer to store all of my lesson plans and school related documents.  The 2.0 GB replaced my 1.0 GB that went through the wash twice, and still worked, but was starting to come apart, they take abuse and keep going. The amount of memory is great.  Its very simple to use, all you need to do is plug it into the USB port and its ready to use just like an old floppy disk.  I have 3 years worth of documents on it and I haven't even made a dent in the amount of memory.  I would highly recommend this product.  Its a great buy for the price

I have had 2 different brands of flash drives.  One was a lexar that i went through 2 in about a 4 month span.  I have 2 of the SanDisk Cruzer Mini 2GB drives and I had NO problems what so ever with speed and durablity.  In fact, both of the drives accidently went through the laundry.  And they both still work.  Greatest drive I EVER got.  Highly recommended!

I've had this drive over a year and have used it continuously to store notes and documents both at school and at work.  This device is slender enough to fit in a laptop USB slot and allow the slot beneath it to be available for another device (Mouse, Thumb drive, etc).  Also, I've accidentally sent this baby through the washer a couple of times.  I don't think it's been in the dryer (yet), but the fact that it's been in water twice and still works makes me glad that I purchased the device I did. By the way, I use my drive to transfer files from every computer I work on, which includes my Mac Mini, my Dell at work, my Macbook Pro at school, and my Linux box serving my web site.  

No drivers were needed for OSX, XP, or Suse Linux.  One last positive statement... The lanyard that comes with the drive works great... It's soft and has a great little clip that has worked hundreds of times for me.  This is a very appropriate drive to wear as a necklace if you need to move a lot of geek tools or data around daily.

One negative for thumb drives in general - they stick out of your laptop, and if you tilt your laptop towards them they may bend or crack... External devices should have built-in joints to mitigate this problem

When I was shopping for a flash drive, I saw that someone complained about the slow speed of this drive. It almost scared me away from buying it, but now I'm glad I don't believe everything I hear. This is the fastest media I've ever used, and if someone has one that doesn't run fast, the problem is with their own system or files. A hundred megs in the blink of an eye is plenty fast enough for me. I'm a hands down believer in the SanDisk Cruzer Mini 2GB USB 2.0 Flash Drive. Stop looking, cause you just found the best buy

I use my Cruzer Mini constantly at work.  It's great for quick data transfers, small utilities, drivers or patching systems that are off the network.  It's slim and lightweight enough that I tend to drop it in my shirt pocket and forget about it.  You probably see where this is going...but yes, it's been run through the washing machine at least four times.  What may be even more impressive is that it's been run through the dryer three times (once I did catch it after being washed and saved it from the dryer, allowing it to air dry instead).  It still works as well as the day I took it out of the package, never missing a beat

Like any good piece of technology, this card stays out of the way, operating fast (I have a Canon Digital Rebel XT), trouble-free (so far), and behind the scenes. I bought this model because it was the best price per storage space solution for the format at the time. I'm sure that very soon, that magical price point will shift to 4 GB or higher

I use this with my Canon Rebel XT, and it works fantastic. 

With 8+ MP camera, you need to have fast media or you might miss a moment.  I have had many SanDisk cards, and they have all worked flawlessly.  This one stays in my camera all the time, and I am hard-pressed to fill it up on a single shoot.

This is the equivalent of dozens of rolls of film... (I dont shoot in RAW, but even if I did, it would be fine)

With the large file size of pro DSLR's shot in RAW, every little bit of speed counts, whether at capture or download.  There are faster Compact Flash cards out there, and there are definately slower ones, but for the price, this is a great card

I use this card with my Nikon D200. The card writes data incredibly quickly, saving my raw 10.2 MP images with no problem. I've used this card in all sorts of conditions, from below freezing to well over 100 degrees with no problems.

The data recovery software included is equally amazing. I was able to salvage pictures on my card I accidentally erased quite long ago with no loss. This comes with a warning--pictures you "deleted" remain on the camera, so it needs to be wiped securely before exchanging hands.

Finally, this card while fast, is only as fast as the camera. If you don't need this speed, there are slower, cheaper ones available

I usually purchase Lexar cards for my 20D.   The sandisk was a better price so I decided to try it.   It is fast with its write speed.   I can pop off a number of images without having to wait for it to write to the card.   The image quality is excellent...I think that the colors may be a little more vibrant than the ones I have on the Lexar cards.   I think that I am going to switch to Sandisk

After having great experience with the 1GB extreme III card, I ordered the 2GB just before I went on a short vacation. I love the speed of the extreme III cards - writing to the card I can actually exceed the camera's stated continuous frame (manual says about 9, but I've gotten over 20 in a row with before a delay) and reading the large amount of data off the card is similarly speedy when using a good usb 2.0 card reader. Sandisk just released the extreme IV cards, but for the price difference I think this card is a better deal

Sandisk, leader in this kind of technology products sure do not come short with this one. It works excellent on my phone Samsung t609.I would have bought a 1GB but the phone manufacturer do not recomend it, so bear that in mind. For pictures the resolution at close range and bright light is just excellent. For music as an MP3, lots of memory and room to fill as well as for video. Data and in general is terrific...just like I said Sandisk leads the competition and also seems to be the the standard card for just about any product that requires this kind of card. I will most definitely and undoubtely will not accept substitutions. Only Sandisk is extremely reliable. Personal experiences with these products proof it repeatledly.

It's been over 19 days since my SanDisk 512MB Transflash card was "shipped" from EMARTBUY and I still have not received my order. When I contacted EMARTCRAP, all they could tell me was that it had been shipped. I am sure that flash card works great. I just hope that I will receive it before it becomes obsolete. AVOID EMARTBUY AT ALL COST. Don't settle for incompetency. Your are better off paying a higher price for better service...correction any service

Start off with the bad news.  I have a Motorola DVR / Converter box with my Comcast cable service, and the Comcast remote sends the ADS box into gonzo fits.  Attempting to use the menu button on the cable remote causes the ADS box to switch inputs.  Using the cable DVR fast-forward button cycles the ADS through screen formats with each button push, etc.  I contacted ADS tech service and they responded that the only fix was to physically separate the two boxes so the remotes could be aimed at one at a time. 

Obviously, this is not acceptable.

Too bad because this box does a much better job than my Philips Cineos at upscaling.  Tivo, analog cable, DVD, Laserdisc all look better.  The improvement is more than worth the hassle of having another remote to handle, but definitely not worth it if you have a Motorola cable box that will conflict.

5 stars for video quality, 3 stars for user interface (which is not so great), subtract all but 1 star for failure to publicise conflict and for failure to solve conflict.

For the Price, I doubt you could do better.  True, there are higer-end devices out there that will improve your picture to the pinnacle of performance, but if all you're after is a significant improvement in the quality of EVERY channel and DVD you watch, you can't beat the ADS for it's price. The biggest flaw is the device's inability to deal with program material that has excessive light or white backgrounds, where the device either creates artifacts or attempts to correct resolution causing my Philips Plasma set to black-out for moments.  This aside, I'm very happy with the ADS, especially it's under $300 price.  One day maybe I'll upgrade to a unit by DVDO, but not until they come don to the sub-$500 range

This is about the least expensive Scaler you will find, Period. I have a Home Theater system which includes a Front projection system with a D-Theater 40000u JVC VCR and a high end DVD Player. The Projectors native resolution is 1024x768. I set the HD VCR for 1080i and use the HDUP1500 HDTV to downconvert the D-theater to my projectors maximum resolution. The Picture looks great. I also use the Scaler to upscale DVD and it does a good job. When you enlarge a dvd Image without the use of the upconverter on a 100" screen it doesnt stand up too well and Normal Televison fairs even worse. This scaler upconverts both and I cant begin to tell what an improvement this scaler makes on quality. One improvement they should make is to include an rgb connection. My projector does not have a component connection so I use a KDS Transcoder. While there are scalers that do a better job they dont come close to the bang for buck you get out of this unit

I still have to review some of the finer functions of the unit, but overall, it does its job.  One major bonus that most overlook, it eliminates a ton of wires going to the monitor/tv.  That is a huge saving right offthe bat.  The native pass-through of 1080i looks good.  A 408i Directv/Tivo looks great upconverted too.  I found the remote to be a bit clunky when changing inputs and using PIP.  It might be just a case of getting used to it.  I am looking for a way of hiding select inputs.  Overall this product simplifies installation of multiple devices and looks good too

This charger does not seem to charge the batteries fully. I thought that my rechargable batteries were "out of life", but discovered that it was just a case of this charger failing to recharge them fully. My Daughter brought home a cheap Sakar overnight charger when visiting. I popped in a set of batteries I thought were done for, and found them to be just fine using her Sakar charger. What happens on my charger is that the lights (indicating that the batteries have been fully charged) all go off, and the batteries are "cool to the touch" (indicating that they have been fully recharged). Nope! Only about half way recharged

I have two of these chargers that I bought directly from Kodak for about $10 each. Each of them came with 4 AAA batteries which do not charge at all straight out of the package. One of the chargers has become defective after somewhat heavy use. Battery charger technology is not all that complicated but Kodak doesn't seem to have mastered it yet. No wonder they were practically giving these away. I'd avoid purchasing these now at any price

I have had this Kodak Charger for almost 2 years now.  I liked it so well I went back and order another one for my daughter.
I use mine to charge AA batteries for my Olympus and S series Canon digital cameras.  My daughter recharges her C-Series Olympus camera and for re-charging  battery operated toys for her twins.  Between the two of us, we have 3 years experience using this model charger.
We like it because it is so portable.  Just fold in the AC prongs and toss it in your bag, purse, or coat pocket.  No need to carry the charger, plus an AC adapter and cord with you.  This charger easily fits in our camera bags.  
I have used the Kodak Rapid Charger to charge various batteries rated in power from 1600 to 2200 milliamps (mA) with no problem.  It usually takes about 3 hours.   What sold me was the portability and the trickle charge.  With some battery chargers, you have to be sure to unplug it after so many hours before it overheats and becomes a fire hazard.  The Kodak Rapid Charger can be plugged in and it will not overheat or overcharge the batteries.  So, if I forget the batteries are charging it is no problem.  I can unplug this charger "whenever".    I especially appreciate that when I travel and can recharge the batteries in an afternoon or overnight in my hotel room.  When I travel is when I am most distracted and not following my normal routine, so that is when I am most apt to forget that I have batteries charging.  Not a problem with this charger.  You can leave the charger plugged in indefinitely.  
This charger lights up with green lights when it is charging.  When the batteries are charged, the lights go out, so it is easy to see when the batteries are fully charged.  Even from across the room.
Some folks have mentioned that the batteries fall out.  I believe that is because when you plug this charger into a wall outlet, the batteries are in a vertical position in the charger.  Gravity will tend to pull them out of the charger if the batteries are not firmly seated in the charger, or you slap the charger against the wall so hard, the batteries will bounce out of the charger.  I have had this happen too.  However, all I had to do is put the batteries the charger and gently insert the charger into the wall outlet.  When I am in a hurry is when I have had the batteries fall out.  Besides, I figured if I cannot gently insert this charger in the wall, I can always use a short extension cord so I can lay the charger in a horizontal position.  However, that would mean I have to carry a cord around and I think that would defeat the portability of this charger though.  I have found it is easier for me to slow down and put the charger gently into the wall so the batteries don't fall out.
I highly recommend this battery charger.

I bought this charger 11 months ago.  It came with 4 Kodak 1850 mA NiMH batteries.  After a few months of light use, the batteries were unable to hold charge as much as 1850 mA batteries should.  If I use the batteries immediately after charging them, I can take about 20 pictures (while my 2000 mA NiMH batteries can do &#62;60).  If I charge them and put them into my camera bag as reserves, they won't be useful after only a week.

The charger is capable of charging both AA and AAA batteries.  But a few months ago, 1 spring for switching between AA and AAA stopped working properly.  This was after very light use.  I only charge AAA batteries once a month.

The market for NiMH batteries and chargers is more competitive than a year ago.  I would not buy this Kodak if I were to buy today

This worked fine at first but after a few months, the charger could not hold the AAA batteries in place. The spring mechanisms failed for 3 out of the 4 positions that would hold the AAA batteries. Thus, I could no longer charge the AAA batteries. Then after a while, the charger just quit working all together

I am new to digital photography. Till now I have mainly used point & shoot film cameras. I purchased this card for my Canon 350D SLR and I am completely satisfied. It stores more than 500 photos at highest quality and I found no delay whatsoever in storing images. The card perfomed very well in continuos shots! People who are complaining about speed must note that this is one of the cheapest branded cards available in the market and should not be compared with higher speed costlier cards

I had bought a lexar professional 512 when the digital rebal first came out at a whopping $230.  It has a write speed of 40x.  I needed to buy a bigger card becuase when I took pictures at events I did not have enough memory and had to keep changing my jpeg quality.  

The kingston was a great choice.  Not only did it have four times the memory but a great price to go with it.  I would recommend this product to most photographers.  The only down side I have had is the write speed claims to be 50x and my lexar at 40x seems to be faster.  If you are a action photographer this is not the card for you, this is why I did not give it a five star rating.  

I went on vacation this month and had plenty of room to spare on the card.  It did everything I needed it to do.

I have been using this on my Canon Rebel XT for about 9 months. I also have a similar CF card made by Sandisk (Ultra II) which I paid much more. I'm fully satisfied with this and don't see any difference in performance between the two. Btw, I shoot in RAW format and the 8 megapixel RAW files are pretty big.

I love the memory size of the card but however when you want to shoot withing a very shot time frame, the card is slow. An excellent example would be a birthday party. You take a snap and want to take the next one, you may have to wait at times and you may end up losing the shot. (Initially I thought it was okay but when it kept repeating I felt a bit disappointed) I have the SanDisk Ultra II 1 GB and it has never had a delay. I would used this card for situations where I have plenty of time between shots. Maybe a still life.

Beware of KINGSTON rebates!

Of course, I hope your experience would differ, if you were to buy Kingston product(s), but mine was terrible.

I bought a Kingston CompactFlash card that offered a $50 mail-in rebate.  I promptly (as in, the day AFTER I received the item delivery) went to photocopy my rebate certificate and UPC code and sales receipt; then sent it all on its merry way.  Yes, I was well within the rebate period, both for the purchase AND for the postmark date.  My purchase was a valid retailer (think HUGE online e-tailer).

The rebate REQUIRED sending THE ENTIRE ORIGINAL UPC label, which was like the entire outside package for my CF card, about the size of 1  business cards when flattened.  No problem.

About TWO MONTHS later, I get a letter saying "your rebate request was denied because you failed to furnish the appropriate ORIGINAL UPC code as required by the rebate offer."

Well, now  WHAT?  I can't RE-SEND the original (it was already in their possession).  I called, and they insisted on repeating what the letter said.  I re-sent my PHOTOCOPIES and they said a photocopy is invalid proof of purchase.

After another 6 weeks of pursuing this, I figured this is their scam.  They simply wouldn't honor the rebate.  And without the ORIGINAL UPC in my possession, I couldn't really submit to their requirements.

If you're looking for a RAM upgrade, I'd suggest you look at a quality company like OCZ (the BEST!), or Patriot, Geil, or Corsair.  If you're looking for a value Flash Memory Card, I might suggest SanDisk.

For one, Kingston does NOT make the best products, they are VALUE-driven products.

Two, there are competitors to Kingston with just as good or better value-to-performance ratios at the same prices.

Three, Kingston will not stand behind their customer as I have experienced.

I urge you to, please, be cautious of Kingston and their rebate scams

cost is low because the company no longer exists - no tech support, no company website (just be prepared)

for Win 2000 and XP, you must download your own drivers - http://www.compgeeks.com/drivers/KBGearTablet.zip has at least the XP driver

It takes some monkeying to get used to, have to press a little harder than you first expect to get it to do anything.

I bought this recently not knowing much about what was out on the market in terms of tablets, and I have some advice if you're going to buy this product. 

Pros: It's a shame Wacom doesn't make tablets that are 5x7 since I have found out that this is the perfect size- it's not so small that you have no room to draw properly, and it's not big enough that you have to hurt your arm  with long movements after a tiring day at work. The price- I bought this for 20 C dollars at the local Radioshack, but you can get one for much cheaper online compared to a Wacom Graphire which is 4x5 and upwards of around 50 US dollars. It's compatible with almost every graphics software and works remarkably well. Unless you're a professional graphics designer, you won't need any of the costly Wacom tablets if you've got this.

Cons: When I first unpackaged it, I was tearing my hair out for two days trying to figure out how to make this work in Windows XP. For all of you out there with a similar problem, download this driver for the newer versions of Windows and relax:

http://www.compgeeks.com/drivers/KBGearTablet.zip 

The pen sensitivity will need to be set to your desired pressure-sensitivity first, so don't try it out before going to Control Panel and changing the settings. I find that the best setting to use for the barrel button option is Left double-click. :) Hope that helped a bit

I'm a computer artist and use the jam studio a bunch. Yes there are driver issues. If you tinker with it some you're fine. The software bundle is useless, but it works with any application. I've tried most tablets, a lot of them make me feel like I'm etching glass. The jam studio has a more natural (not to mention perfect size!) drawing surface than the rest. I even like the corded pen. I don't have to go far when it gets dropped. More pressure levels would be nice but not a must. Hey at this price I would buy two. It's a shame the company went under, this product got written off rather quickly...it's too bad

I just received my sketch pad - mainly for the use of playing Isketch (isketch.net) - but I tried it out in my PSP program, and it works just fine in there also.  I didn't even use the software/disks that came with it.  I have WinXP and got the drivers for it @ http://www.virtualinformation.com/support/index.htm and everything works just fine! :)  It does take a little bit to get used to using (been using a mouse for so long) but I love it

Cosmetically pleasing is about the only good thing you can say about this unit.  The included software does contain viruses.  The included software is a reminate of the late 80's to early 90's.  The tablet itself does not work under Win2000 nor WinXP.  Under 98 second edition it stops responding quite frequetly and you have to unplug and plug the unit back in to get it to respond again.  This unit would be great, if it came out 7 years ago.  You get what you pay for

This is now my go-to bag.  It has excellent build quality and it's pretty much the perfect size.  I really like the style and the way it fits, staying very close to my body, and it it easy to pull around to the front.  
I have mine holding my Digital Rebel with my 70-200 4L, 50mm 1.8, EFS 60mm, and Kit lens.  That pretty much fills up the main comparment.  The front pocket is big enough for all of my accessories (except flash).

I have only 2 minor gripes.  1: The color is a little different than in the online images.  2: The shoulder strap starts off nice and wide, but becomes very thin by the time it reaches my shoulder.  Carrying it fully loaded can start to bother my shoulder after a few hours.  I think i'm going to have to try to add some padding or widen the strap myself somehow.  This shouldn't be a problemif you have lighter gear.

It's probably the best value bag i have seen

I had no problems burning to these discs, its when I went back a few months later to these discs and found out that none of them work anymore. After further research I found out that Memorex uses the cheapest dye available and thus the DVDs have absolutelly no life to them, my discs started dying after a few months.
In addition, in you physically hold the disc in your hands you can feel how warped physically it has become. This is true for all the discs (about 150 of them). I CAN NOT NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT STRONLY ENOUGH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I first tried these blank DVDs and they did not work for me and I was very frustrated.  There was clear labeling on the package that new firmware was needed for many DVD writers to work with these discs.  However, my DVD writer was a variation of what was listed.  So I tried about 10 discs and only 1 worked.  Tonight I downloaded the firmware for a variation of my HP drive and all works fine.

Bottom line - expect to download the firmware and these will work great

Out of the past 20 burns, I have only had 10 DVD's burn successfully.  I use Roxio CD Creator version 7, which does a great job with my CD's, so I'm pretty sure it's the DVD media.  Not only am I wasting all my money, but my time as well.  I've tried to lower the burn speed, but it does not matter.  I'd try something else

... Especially for DVDs.  These have been working perfectly for me.  I haven't wasted one disk.  I had similar problems before when I purchased the incorrect media.  I would try and try to burn a dvd and got an error every time.  After tons of trouble-shooting, I realized that I needed this type for the hardware that I have.  I haven't had one problem since I changed.  CHECK YOUR HARDWARE/SOFTWARE prior to purchasing to make sure it is all compatible.  It will save you a lot  of time and trouble

Bad bad bad.  I'm not sure exactly what is wrong with these discs, whether it is flimsy material or an asymmetrical center but they are not reliable.  I purchased a 50 spindle and from the first 28 used only one worked properly.  This is an expensive waste.  I suggest going with better quality discs at the outset.  It will save on headache later

I would avoid these discs.  I have been using these discs for some time doing backups.  Recently, I've had a few problems and decided to look at these further.  I noticed another review that said that the discs are made by multiple companies under the Memorex brand as are others like TDK, etc..  I used to DVD info and noticed that my most recent purchase is made by CMC and I'm having problems with some of the discs including burn errors. One disk has strange ring in the die.   I have the NEC 1300a burner.  I also having some trouble playing backups on the same drive on my computer. Less trouble playing on my Sony DVD player. Just based on this (not a clear indication of what you're getting when you purchase), I would go with something else. These discs are not cheap enough for this reason.

I've been looking for a way to fix the DVDs our toddler "enjoys". Obviously he shouldn't handle them, but he loves "helping" so how can I resist. Unfortunately he scratched up his favorite DVD to the point it won't play most sections. So this device arrives and I run the repair, buffer then repair, repair and clean. And to my disappointment the disc wasn't playable... until, I tried using more than a few (small) drops of the repair paste. Using three big drops and his DVD is playable once again. I'm repairing and cleaning DVDs from the Library too. If we still had Netflix this would be indispensable.

The instructions are clear and the device works quickly. Its pretty noisy though

I had a rare DVD disc that had developed a tangle of faint cracks, making later tracks unplayable.

I used the advice given in an earlier review to use two drops of the repair fluid (aluminum oxide) for the initial cycle and single drops thereafter.  This was good advice and made some improvements, but there was persistent stalling and break-up in some tracks.

The unit works by having an electric motor spin two cylinders, each of which rubs an annulus-shaped surface against the CD or DVD. The set comes with each repair surface attached to a flat disc with three prongs, mounted into a clear plastic base.  The buffing surface comes only on its disc-tripod.  To go between repair and buffing, one must use an enclosed small plastic brush-crowbar to pry open the surface between the disc-tripod and the clear plastic base.  This is not mentioned in the instructions.

Also not mentioned is that one may buff more than once.  I ended up buffing four times.  This was probably more than necessary.  Sometimes one may put on too much of the repair fluid, which may find itself spread unevenly or left in small clumps.  The result is that areas of the DVD that had played all right before now break up because of irregularities or waves in the fluid coating itself.  My final cycle involved two larger drops, followed by using the repair cycle without putting any extra fluid on.  This may have smoothed the coating without the more severe action a buffing would have given.

Now the disc works all right throughout.  There is some loss of picture sharpness, but it's acceptable.

Along the way, I sent the customer service rep at Aleratec two e-mails seeking advice.  The responses were fast, courteous, and helpful. 

The product does work but needs more complete instructions and suggestions.  Skill rises with practice.   Be patient at first.

I ordered this on the recommendation of another Amazon customer. I wasnt impressed. I though this would save me money because until then I had been just buying new copies of my favorite CDs that were scrathced up. I cleaned a few discs and ran them through all three "processes" without successful results. It didnt seem to make much difference with any of my discs. I dont think this is a good "repairer" of any disc thats more than mildly scratched. My suggestion would be to just replace your damaged discs by buying another copy of your CD or DVD on AMAZON!! Many of my CDs I have replaced for $7-10 bucks on here. I wish I wouldve kept my $25

Much to my dismay, the item arrived DOA, and even tech support was not readily available. I eventually filed an RMA with the seller, but I had to pay for return shipping costs. There apparently is no such thing as "quality control" from the seller in an item as simple as this, and for this I rate this item such. While the replacement works, I would recommend others to not buy this until they have tried the age-old "soap water" solution first

Price difference between 2Gb and 1GB is too high ,otherwise I will go for 2GB in the sameproduct line.It come in sealed retail package.I upgraded my camera firmware to latest in order to use this product trouble free

After purchasing this memory card, I realized I should have purchased it with my camera instead of waiting as long as I did.  Before this upgrade, my camera had a maximum of 18 3.2mp pictures.  Now I can take 611.  I can also now use the video feature of my camera without fear of filling it up.

Why wait?  This is the best card I could find for the money.  If you're thinking about more memory than this, I wouldn't bother unless you take a huge number of photos or have an extremely high res camera.

Not sure if I just got a lemon or what but would never purchase this player again. It worked right most of the time, but found that at times it would confuse the change disc button with the eject button. I would have to turn the unit on and off to get it to "reset" and work correctly.  It's now about 9 months later and the unit decided it was time to stop working.
Bought it because it was cheap and I guess I got what I paid for. Fork out the extra cash and purchase another brand

I researched what was the best 5 disc changer and this has all the needed features. Continues to get high marks from various consumer groups. Sometimes I have trouble with the automatic play the next dics but I think that is due to a setting I have incorrect. This is the second one I have purchased. First one the power switch is bad we think and it was less money to purchase new than fix. Will probably fix first on the cheap and give to a friend. Then if second one does same thing we know how to fix it.

I received this unit via my home insurance after my RCA 5-disc changer was stolen.

The unit itself is solidly built, and I don't have any issues with the playback performance or picture quality. I think if you get this unit, you'll be pretty happy with it.

What stinks is the documentation, remote, and setup.

The manual is your typical poorly-translated engrish guide that most people have come to expect from inexpensive electronics. Fortunately, if you've had any experience setting up a DVD player, there's not much different here.

Unless you want progressive scan.

Here's what you have to do if you want to use progressive scan mode:

1. Connect both the component cables AND an S-Video (or composite) cable to your TV. Hopefully it has both inputs (most HDTVs do).
2. Put your TV on the S-Video (or composite) input.
3. Enter the Setup menu (not to be confused with the Options menu!) and choose Progressive output.
4. Now you can unhook the S-Video (or composite) cable and put your TV on Component input mode.

Thankfully this is a one-time hassle, but it's still assinine that Panasonic couldn't have either designed an autodetect or used a physical switch like my old RCA had. With the RCA, I just hooked up the component cables, flipped the switch, and set up the DVD player for 16:9 aspect ratio and I was done.

Lastly, the dreaded H07 error. I think I figured out what's probably causing the majority of them: when you eject the tray, the currently playing CD/DVD is still on the motor and continues to play. A neat feature for swapping the other discs without interrupting your music, but the upshot is that the ejected tray has an empty slot in it.

Can you guess what happens if you accidently put another CD/DVD into the seemingly empty slot by mistake?

To avoid this, instead of using the Eject function, use the Swap function. This will stop the playback and make sure all the discs are out of the drive and avoid damage.

Overall, a great player for the price. Just be careful with it and bear with the tricky setup

After reading some of the previous reviews, I wanted to state that this player definitely plays back multichannel DVD-Audio discs.  If you're only hearing sound out of 2 speakers, then there must be a setting you need to change in the setup menu.

Also, I've burned many DVD-R's on various DVD burners (not Panasonic branded) and they've all played back flawlessly on this Panasonic DVD-F87S player.

Haven't had any problems with this player and I've owned it for 18 months now.

I love this DVD player.  A huge step up from my old one, which was not a progressive scan.  I didn't have too difficult of a time getting used to the controller, which is always a pain when you get a new system.  And the on-screen features are fun.  I like the ability to adjust the position of the subtitles.  I watch movies a lot with them on and it's just nice to have some more freedom with that. 

Overall, this DVD player isn't the absolute "Best" DVD player out there, but if you're looking for a high quality player for a low budget price, this is definitely the perfect item.

This DVD player is a great, mid-range player that encompasses a wide variety of disc formats. One of the best features is that it can store the exact position of playback for 5 discs so that if you stop watching one movie and move on to another, you can go back the next day and pick right up where you left off.

I have tried playing DVDs, DVD+R and CD-R (with JPG images) and all have worked successfully

I have purchased three of these dvd players in the past 2 1/2 years, every one of them has had the same problems.  Trouble reading dvds, dvds skipping, discs freezing and the manual buttons stopped working on two of the units.  The price is right on the unit, but not for the time it worked.  I would have been better off spending double or triple the unit price to get one that worked for more than 6 months without a problem.  If I could give it less than 1 star I would because thats really what it is worth, nothing

I've had this DVD player for over two years now and it has worked perfectly even with the scratched up DVDs you get from a rental store. I have never put a disc in this player and it not play. Not only is it a wonderful player but it can be set to region free this was a very much appreciated added bonus for me because I buy a lot of Region 2 DVDs. If you are looking for a cheap, very good, and region free DVD player this one is the right choice. The picture is great, the sound is great and its performance is wonderful.

I bought this player because I wanted to play dvds from various regions.  The good news is that it plays discs from all regions outside of region 1 just as well as it plays those in region 1.  The bad news is that I never found a disc which the unit could play through in its entirety.  It would click, grind and sputter along for 30 or, on a good day, 50 minutes before just freezing up.  Save your money or buy a coby dvd-224, which is an infinitely superior unit

This dvd player is potentially a great, cheap and versatile machine BUT... 

The two i bought from Worldwide Distributers were faulty.  I have a friend who owns a CH-DVD 300 which works perfectly with my Region 2 (English) DVDs. I have a CyberHome DVD player in England which works perfectly as well.  The two machine i received didnt work very well and didnt play some discs at all. This is why i would recommend spending a bit more on another machine.  After returning two players i decided to buy a Philips DVP5140 (Multiformat DVD Player with Divx, MP3, Windows Media Support) which with a code to allow it to play all regions works perfectly!  It cost $60 with free shipping through amazon so wasn't actually much more expensive than the other player!  (See the reviews of this player for the code!)

I would also like to say that there was nothing wrong with the service from Worldwide Distributors and that they refunded most of the shipping costs. The problem was ONLY with the DVD players they sent me

I ordered the Cyber-Home DVD on 07/21/2006 and so far I have no problems. The quality of the picture is great. I like the fack that the DVD unit is little and fits everywhere, you almost don't see it. It's light and easy to install.
Thanks,

I bought this power supply because the breastpump that I used did not have a car adapter.  Instead of buying a new breastpump, this Linksys Car Cigarette Power Supply saved the day.  It works wonderfully and has a safety mode that will disconnect the power if you are trying to power something out of reach of what the Power Supply can do.  It would work wonderfully for laptops as well as other small electrical items that you need mobility with

It came with the stickers all peeling off. Used it for about a month and the item failed on me. Then the bad news, it blew the fuses in my car and all my electronics stopped working. Tried it on a friends car and I blew his fuses (car and person). Look for something else. Seems to be a common problem. 

UPDATE: Linksys replaced this product instantly. Works but a little worried it will fail again.

About a year ago I got one of these to allow me to play DVDs for my kids on my laptop while travelling.  It has an alarm that sounds when your battery is getting too low -- well it sounded immediately .  I figured that my car battery was not fully charged or on its last legs.  I hadn't tried to use it since.  Now that I'm taking another trip, I thought I'd try it out in other cars.  No luck.  The thing is dead -- doesn't do a thing when I plug it in

These headphones do not possess the latest technology, but just work. You do need 'line of sight' to the transmitter, for them to work, but that is just about the only con I've found. They are really comfortable to wear, even after a few hours, but the best thing they have is the battery life.

With the supplied rechargeable batteries, they are supposed to last up to 40 hours on a single charge. The longest I've used them is for 12 hours straight and for another 8 hours the next day before recharging them and did not fail. Recharging them is a matter of leaving them on the cradle/transmitter overnight, and they will be ready for the next day.  If you go with regular batteries (optional) they are supposed to last for over 60 hours before they need to be replaced, which is a great option, allowing you to use regular batteries after the rechargeable ones finally wear out and get another set.

I bought them to use with my computer to replace regular headphones, and installation was as simple as plugging in the connectors, and the transmitter power supply. They just worked.  I've also hooked them up to my stereo and TV with the same ease, and am seriously thinking about purchasing another pair to save me from plugging and unplugging them from different appliances

The first unit worked OK for about a month but then just stopped transmitting, if you unplugged it and plugged it back in again it would work for about 5 minutes and then stop again. Returned it for a replacement and the exact same thing happened in 2 weeks. Returned second unit for credit and will buy something else. Both units had a lot of static, even at low to moderate volume level

The Nike+ system has really been a good motivator for me. As a new runner, I need all the motivation and positive reinforcement I can get. The challenges and goals are a good way to keep on track as well.

I didn't buy the Nike+ shoes - I use mine with the Marware Sportsuit Relay set up. It's a great system and a lot cheaper than spending $100 for a pair of running shoes when I already have a couple good pairs in the closet. 

Both products are highly recommended

While the sports kit is very reliable and fun to use, I found it still to be more of an mp3 player than a training tool.  Better for the more casual mid-week run than speed work or keeping track of the details of a long training run.  

This is not to say it's not a great running tool.  The website is great and offers a lot of motivation.  And, you don't need to be wearing Nike shoes to use this.  There are many options on ebay and in sports stores that will attach the pode to your current running shoe.

...but I still like my garmin forerunner better..

This device is awesome.  I absolutley highly recommend it, especially since I used it on the treadmill and discovered the treadmill, all this time, has given me inaccurate distances.  I don't wear Nike sneakers, but it was easy enough to make a little pouch for the transmitter and pin it under my laces onto the tongue of the sneaker.  I love that it tracks my runs for me and graphs them so I can see my progress.

If you're considering it, buy it, you won't regret it

This is an amazing product that has pushed me to exercise at another level.  Easy to use, tried with old NB shoes and new Nike+ shoes.  I did calibration only once, tradmill shows a slighty different reading, but at the end, it has pushed me to record an amazing number of miles that I never thought I could do in a short period of time.

The Nike+iPod Sport Kit is an excellent addition to the iPod line.
Unfortunately, it only works with Nike+ shoes. Which are hard to find and
a number of us don't like how they fit or prefer other shoe types.
You can still use the Nike+iPod with other shoes. There are a number of home brewed ways
and retail products. We like the $5.99 Shoe Pouch.
You can find the Shoe Pouch at [...]It will securely attach the sensor to any type shoe.
Otherwise, way to go Nike and Apple, great product

I was very interested in buying this product even before it came out, but I have to say I am disappointed.  This product does not offer any thing that a digital watch timing your run, a play list that is constructed before you run and figuring our your miles before you run on the street and it is even less useful if you are going on a treadmill.  I say less useful on the treadmill because it keep track of the distance for you, and when running on the street its not that hard to chart out a running path for you before you go out and run.  This product is not the breakthrough that a lot of people think it is.  
I am a fan of Apple products, have owned 4 Ipod, 2 Ibooks, an Imac and a MacMini but after buying this product I have decided to sell it because it doesn't do any thing that can do on your own.  I don't think that my mind would change if they added a heart monitor because you know that they up-charge for that probably into the 60-dollar range. 

I have been running for the past 3 months on a daily basis, and have run 5K-10K and half marathons in the past.

At age 52, overweight with type 2 diabetes and high cholesterol, I decided to save my life and buy new nano and nike+ unit here.

The unit is a joy to use. Autosync-ing your runs to the nike+ website couldn't be easier. Note I have dial-up only connection (&lt;32kbps). Watching your run data collect on the nice nike+ graphical interface is great fun!

As stated by several here, nike+ shoes are not necessary. I put my shoe unit in an unused luggage tag and stuffed between my New Balance tongue and laces.

Minor complaint: During workout, I can't fast-forward/reverse within songs that are playing  (a minor complaint when one considers I am now running 2 miles daily!)

Try the "PODRUNNER" podcast at iTunes to find free and extended workout mixes tailored to your desired beats-per-minute (BPM)

I've had this card for about 1 1/2 years now and it has performed flawlessly. It has seen thousands of photos (no exaggeration!) on my digital camera and now holds data/mp3s for my palm too. Did you know you can pop your SD card out of a camera and into a palm to view photos? I just learned this. Anyway it's a nice product and I'm about to get another SimpleTech with 512 megs or higher if they have one. If you are new to SD memory, always get more storage than you need because eventually you'll buy something that will use one (camera, handhelds, cell phones, etc. -- note that many cell phones use a smaller "MiniSD")

Sandeep's review was informative, but for photographers like myself, I'm not going to be too concerned about a difference of 6 MB (actual 122 MB instead of 128 MB). All I'm concerned about is will the card retain the data in a consistent, accurate and dependable manner; not like what happened to the poor guy who lost his using a Sandisk memory card. The price is right, too. I've had this Simpletech 128 MB SD card for 2 years now, and haven't had one single problem with it

I bought one of these for my Magellan Meridian GPS (green / brown).  It works flawlessly and is MUCH cheaper than the Magellan brand Secure Digital Cards.  Note: depending upon what version of the firmware you have for your Magellan Meridian, you may need to upgrade to access this large of a memory card

I am very happy with my ebookman-901, there are one or two things that I am not too pleased about. Number one being the MMC , once you load one that you have stored books on, back into your ebookman to read later on, is that its takes forever for it to bring the books up to read, also its makes up the ebookman infor., you end up having to download the os applications again or it won't sync. The second thing is its hard finding places that you can find to download music from onto your ebookman. But since I mainly use mine to for ebooks that's is great by me. Thanks again for this product I can carry so my books with me now to choose to read from now

Straight forward: you should buy this. 

Here's the pro's and cons

Pro's:

1 It has a nice screen, even though it is B&W, that would never get in the way. The screen is nice and large, perfect for the ebook-type person. With 3 different font sizes, you can see it in your way.

2 It has a lot of features. It has a book reader (Mobipocket Reader, a nice program), MP3 player, Date Book, To-Do, Calculater, Audio Book Player, and Address Book. Plus, you can download programs from places such as Windows Market Place or C Net downloads.com

3 It has handwriting recignition (or a touch screen keyboard). I always found this handy and while it's not always right, the people at Franklin really got this down.

4 The whole thing is touch screen. This means you can play games on it and not be restricted to only a certian area. I had this problem with my last PDA. This also means you can download games.

5 MMC cababilty. You can have gigabytes plus the 8mb on the RAM. The ebookman also allows you to back up data, a handy feature for battery drainage. 

6 The software is easy to use. The simple drag and drop-download system is a breeze. While some people say that downloading the OS (operating system) from the site is a pain, they didn't mention that the CD already comes with the OS.

7 Convienient side scroll wheel with push in ability. You can use this instead of the scroll bars, and you can push the wheel in to enter. It's cool!
Con's:

1 The batteries go fast! I advise to have a spare set, and back up the data on an MMC. Don't use the backlight, that is what burns it up. The handy thing is that it has a battery indicator, so you know when it is time to change up.

2 Limited file types. The ebookman allows mostly its own versions of files, such as audio books and ebooks. However, it does accept .txt (Notepad) and .MP3 (music), plus a bunch more. 

3 While it has a speaker, if you plan to lisen to something you should bring some headphones. The speaker is nice, yet quiet. 

4 The date book's alarm is very quick. What is cool about the alarms is that there is over 20 alarms that you can choose. However, the alarm only does one cycle, and then it stops. It uses an internal speaker, so you can barely here it while it is in a pocket.


Otherwise, the ebookman is pretty good. While I got this from my aunt and didn't pay a penny, I think that if this is your first PDA, it's a good choice to get it for your money. And if it is true that this is your first time, you also want to get a case, screen protectors, and MMC cards (for more memory). This won't total up to more than $20. 

Many say the batteries are drained quickly. This is true (in about 2 weeks for frequent users), however if you do not use the backlight much you will be ok. The backlight for the 7 inch screen is the burner of all batteries. Watch the convienient battery power indicator, and you should be ok. That's what I think; the desision is up to you

I bought one of these when they were on clearance for less than $30 and it works wonderfully. A lot of the complaints out there are because people don't know how to use this device correctly

1) You have approximately 30 seconds to change the batteries. Once the AAAs are out of the unit, the memory is kept alive through the use of a capacitor. I know, I've tried it myself. So don't wait until the batteries are dead to change them. That defeats the purpose. And as with any electronic device, you should have a spare set of batteries on hand. 30 seconds is a lot of time. If you can't change the batteries in 30 seconds, well, then...

2) The little humming noise that I've experienced is only when the backlight is on. This is nothing more than stepped up voltage powering the EL backlight.

3) There is an onboard file manager if you can't find the file you're looking for. You can even assign to each file the folder under which it should appear (to a limited extent - works better with program files). If that doesn't work, then the synch software should display your file.

4) I have a scr***le-like game, pacman, periodic table of the elements, a few songs on my 64MB mmc, some books that were free off the internet, and lots of other neat little programs. Everything works fine. Music quality is amazing for something that i think is slower than my 386DX. Ok, it's not THAT good, but for less than $30 it makes one cheap "mp3" player.

5) The character recognition system is in my opinion, much easier to use and remember than that of other PDAs (Palm comes to mind). It more closely matches how normal people write.

6) You can backup all of your files to a 64MB mmc. That way if you forget to change the batteries in a few months, you can always restore the system from the mmc, which is much faster and more convenient than reinstalling from scratch. Again, all it takes is a standard backup, like you would a PC.

All in all, this is a great device. There are a lot of free software out there for this device, and if you know how to use it correctly, it should be a joy to have

I bought the Ebookman 901 without knowing anything about it, and I have been very pleasantly surprised at how versatile it is. Just add a 128 MB MMC card (which are now pretty reasonable on E-bay) and you can have 2 hours of music to go! I have another 64 MB MMC card in it on which I have all the books I have downloaded. A 64 MB card will hold almost 100 regular books! The MobiPocket Reader is great for casual reading, and the Franklin Reader has all the navigation features to make it great for references. I can read any book in HTML or TXT format, and there are thousands for free on the web. The Ebookman also has some nice accessories like a car stereo adaptor and an AC adaptor for home use. The PDA functions like Address Book and Memo Book and Date Book are very handy. There are some really fun games. I take this unit when I am traveling, and am never bored. I think if you read the manual and learn how to use it properly, you will love this device. And now you can find them on E-bay and Heartland America for less than 50 bucks. WOW

This product stinks.  Typically, the documentation is not written in standard English, but in some cyber-patois that no civilized person understands.  Their support material is exhaustive and exhausting and solves no user problem.  I bought it primarily for book reading and, so far, have not been able to access a single one.  The &quot;desktop manager&quot; tells me the &quot;synchronization&quot; went ok, but that proves to be false.  The stories I downloaded are nowhere to be found.  I look under Franklin Reader and find nothing.  I look under Mobi Reader and find the same.  I don't need another calculator, or memo book, or solitaire game, or voice recorder, or mp3 player, or phone book.  I wanted a portable library for fiction, nonfiction, whatever, and this gadget will not give it to me.  If you remember the Seinfeld episode in which the foreign professor threw the electronic organizer out the window, you have an idea of what I feel like doing with this thing.  I bought it from a clearance company on ebay for 50 bucks, so it's not a huge loss.  But I did want an ebook reader.  Apparently, there are a lot of ebooks online for the taking (or buying), but I'll never see them, not with the Franklin ebookman anyway.  And I'm certainly not going in search of another device.  Once burned, twice shy

I used several high speed CD-R disks to burn music CD for my 1998 car. However, they just cannot be readable. But this CD-R has multiple written speeds, so it can burn a great CD suitbale for the old CD in my car as well as new CD of course.

We buy these because the price is low and you get 50 cd's in a pack. This is handy for backing up the PC (uh, when DID you last back up YOUR data?)

You can put pictures, files, music on these cds. We use them just for data backup, and use Fellowes software and labels to make custom labels with contents. These are filed in an album and it's easy to reload or retrieve data in this manner. We have not had any problem writing or reading these cds

I use these primarily to record music compilations from my CD collection... I originally intended to use them in the car during long trips.  I was very please and surprised to find that they sound teriffic on my high end stereo rig as well... giving up only the smallest amount of resolution and detail...losses that only an audio nut like myself would detect.

First off--I'm old(ish) in my 50's and I watched my daughter using her iPod nano.  Then she started playing me songs from her iPod, then I started really liking some of the songs, then I got jealous, so I asked for my own for my birthday.  So I got the biggest and newest, and I love it.  It has fantastic sound.  I play it in my car.  I also use it to listen to audiobooks.  I can't wait to watch movies on it.  It is also very easy to use.  So I give it 5 stars

I love my new iPod. I bought this one after my 60GB iPod Photo was "misplaced". I had a library of about 6,000 songs (small for what this thing can hold) and the first time I updated the new iPod with the library I got error messages every 700 songs or so. I had to restart the whole updating process about 9 times until I finally got al my songs into the iPod. This was problem number one (which I don't expect to happen again unless I update the iPod whith more than 700 songs at a time). 

Problem number two: if I'm searching for a song by artist, it won't display all the songs I have by that artist in the iPod. Say I have like 20 songs by Madonna, and I search for Madonna on the artists menu, I only get like 5 of the 20 songs there are. That didn't happen with my old iPod.

But all in all, it's a great product and I would buy it all over again if I had to

When trying to download information to the Ipod, I keep getting error messages reading Ipod is corrupt and it asks me to restore the Ipod.  Sometimes the software will recognize the Ipod and other times it won't.  I have installed and reinstalled the software several times, but it does not seem to fix the problem.

This is a perfect mp3 player. I had the 40Gb model before this and needed a bit of extra room. You can't ask for anything more than this. It does everything an mp3 player should, and more (podcasts, videos, photos). I bought the 60 a couple of weeks before the 80 was released at the same price. Bad timing on my behalf..

I have a number of toys in my older age, and the Apple I-Pod is clearly a favorite! I use it in the car. I use it with my high-end home system. I use it for music enjoyment first and then and occasional audio book. I also use it during a workout. When I travel or get stuck waiting somewhere for something I will use the video. All the functions work great. It's easy to use and it does so much it's just about ridiculous. It's the Mother of all gadgets. If you buy one (and you will be glad) I recommend getting a protective case for it just to keep it looking like new. This compact wonder is one of the few things in life that will give me my moneys worth (and more).

Hi,
I recently got this system from overstock.com and put it with the Philips 23" flat screen LCD TV I bought from Amazon.com.  Together these are great.  I have had no problem with the DVD play and I love having a radio tuner built in... one less appliance needed and with lovely sound.  Granted, I live in a small apartment and I doubt I would turn the sound up to really take advantage of the system (don't want the neighbors calling).  But for the price it is perfect and the two together look great in my home and perform very well

While the price for this HTS is very nice, the performance is substandard.  There's a hissing sound when the unit is off.  The DVD player has trouble playing DVDs.  I have a large DVD collection & most of them don't play.  The surround quality is also very poor. It's a stretch to call it surround sound when half of the speakers don't put out much sound.  In order to get this serviced, I have to send it out for up to 3 months.  I bought a progressive DVD player, put the audio through the Phillips HTS 3400 and the video to the TV and suddenly the picture was better and the sound was better.

The sound was great, but the DVD would lag every 10-15 seconds during any and all movies.  It drove me nuts. I had to return it.

This Philips HTS3400 DVD has all the features I need, but its mp3 player is really bad: Audio just pops before moving to a next song . It looks like what Philips' people just do in all of their electronics.  I really don't want to talk about this any more because William R. French and  A. Isaicu all talke about these problems

I purchased this amazing Home Theater system at Sam's Club.  I also purchased a Phillips plasma tv. Together these two make beautiful music. When i first heard this amazing Home Theater, i couldn't believe how good it sounded. It reminded me of a more expensive Bose system for a fraction of the price. My friends always ask me how much i paid for it thinking i spent a fortune, but i did not. I paid $189 on sale. I even use it as my regular home stereo. I gotta tell you, my CD's have never sounded better. The subwoofer produces amazing deep bass and the highs are out of this world. Get this, you won't regret it!

P.s, 

I've had mine for 3 weeks with no problem at all!!!

It came down to a choice between a $40 sound system with a seperate dvd player or this $200 system. The reason I purchased it was because it would save on space. Well, it may save on space, but the functionality was reduced to nearly ZERO. The cons:
-Audio popped in and out when playing MP3 CD's. Also a cracking sound when it actually played the audio.
-Hissing (especially from the rear speakers) when the unit was turned off.
-Low volume from the rear speakers.
-Didn't play many DVD's right (it would just stop, as if it couldn't read it).
-Will not read DVD-R/RW's.
-STUTTERING PICTURE. It did this on ALL DVD'S PLAYED. Every few seconds (it was an intermittent length of time between ocurrences) it looked as if it would drop a few frames. The audio never varied from being spot on, but it looked as if the player couldn't keep up with the DVD. This is what killed it for me. This COULD BE because of a defective unit, however, I will not be risking my money on another Philips player. 

The pros:
-Good audio output. That's about it.

My expectations were disappointed HORRIBLY. I will not be buying another philips if I can help it at all. Instead, I bought a Sony slimline DVD player($75 with a $40 sound system) and it is far superior. Far. AND it plays DVD-R/RW's

July 31st 2005:
I was looking for a DVD player for my bedroom at Costco and couldn't resist the $179 price for this brand new Philips HTS3400 (HTS3410 is the same except that it comes all in silver rather than silver/black). 
I played some DVDs and CDs and after 2 days i decided to return it for 2 reasons:
1. It makes a hissing sound when it's turned off. Now, it wouldn't bother me too much in a basement (althought it would still be anoying), but it's a definite NO NO in the bedroom.
2. Rear speakers are almost silent no matter how much you increase the volume to them.

If you don't mind these 2 things, then by all means go for it.

Aug 2005 UPDATE:
Having nothing better to do, I went and purchased another unit from Costco to see if indeed I have a bad unit or it's a design/manufacturing issue.
Surprise surprise...second unit makes the same exact noise only a bit louder!
Curious enough (i'm a mechanical engineer with some knowledge of electronics) i open the unit to see where is this noise coming from. It is the AC/DC transformer, more specific two 330uF capacitors making this noise.
That is really poor design and/or low quality components!!! I did not expect this from a brand name like Philips. This is no different than any no name units out there at half price.

As a result I am changing my initial reivew and recommend that you look for a different product, this one is definately not worth the money. I cannot update the stars but this time I would rate it with 0 stars.

Oct 2006 Update: It stopped reading CDs but it reads DVDs no problem. Returned to Costco!

Works very well. I ran my CD and DVD "test subjects" thru about 10 times and the discs would physically start to curl up, like a potato chip.

Which would further prevent any attempt to read them. 

Of course, I was just playing around with this new toy, but I think just once thru the unit will really mess up any chances at recovery of data.

Also, my box, bought via Office Depot included FIVE software titles: [reportedly worth $149.99]
1. Hacker smacker - firewall
2. Stop Spam
3. Internet Cleanup
4. Stuffit - standard edition
5. Restore it 3

And 2 more bonuses:

1. FREE subscription to the spamslicer program [Home edition]
or $50.00 off the business edition.
[I'm not going to type it all out, but details of what spam slicer is and the program available to anyone that buys this unit, are available at (...)].

2. ID theft prevention - (...)


             FINAL CONCLUSION:


I think this item is more than sufficient for the home and/or small business user.

Norazza company offers larger data disc destroyer units for folks that need to destroy massive quantities of discs, on a regular basis.

              2 thumbs up

I was looking for an innovative product that could quickly and affordably destroy a large number of cd/dvds.  I work for a small business and we have lots of disks to be destroyed on a regular basis.  This was an instant solution and very affordable.  We are so pleased that we plan on making it mandatory to have on everyone's desktop! DON'T HESITATE, BUY IT NOW!!!

I work for a small business and we can't afford the risks of data theft.  Having this unit has put my mind to ease, especially since I work with very sensitive data. 

If you love gadgets, this is an extremely cool product to have.  Its sleek  and within seconds destroys your data.  Its very compact and heavy duty, so its durable and can easily fit in a home office, as well as any place at work. You just insert the disc and within seconds thousand of tiny imprints are made on both sides of the disc making the disc unreadable.  

This is a great product because it securely destroys the data without having to shred the disc and having shattered broken pieces of plastic everywhere.  For anyone who has owned or operated a disc shredder, they are very messy.  This is an excellent alternative.  Is so quick and easy to use, anyone can operate it.  

This should be a household requirement, as much as any other appliance in your home.  

I received my Norazza Data Destroyer within a couple days of placing my order which was very fast service. 

I strongly recommend this product for personal as well as for business use!!!

La memoria cumple muy bien con todas sus funciones, a�n que a veces tuve problemas con la tapa al meter el producto en el bolsillo y esta se sal�a. Pero en fin, solo hay que tener un poco de cuidad y listo. Sugiero a la fecha los productos Lexa

Pros
-Smaller than other flash drives
-Has a lock switch
-Has a ring so you can hook it up with your keys.
-Survived being washed in the washing machine. I waited a day for it to dry up. When I plugged it back in the pc the data that I had before remained intact.

Cons
-Plastic purple body scratches easily, especially if you keep it with your keys.
-128 mb might be a little too small for some people

I bought my Lexar 128mb JumpDrive when the cost was much higher, and I still consider it a bargain. Large enough for most storage requirements, small enough to carry around in my pocket -- it's a perfect solution to so many computer needs!

I have to switch files among several computers: my Mac at home, my PC at work, a Mac laptop and a PC laptop. I don't know how I did it before I had my Lexar

Nine bucks???  for 128mb???  I still have a lap top with a 250mb hard drive.  This little baby is so low priced and convenient it makes zip disks and cdr's seem just stupid.  The clear colored plastic is cool because you can see the guts.  This one is a no brainer if you want to be able to grab stuff on the fly.  Don't leave home without it

This product really does make a difference.  I had an older CD player that was doing a lot of skipping, and sometimes it would not function at all.  I ran the cleaning disc through it once, and now it's working just fine.  Great item to have around even if you only need to use it once a year... certainly beats having to buy a new CD or DVD player

Over the course of the last few months my CD player had gone from the occasional skip to eventually not being able to play a CD at all. 5 minutes after my package arrived with this CD cleaner in it and I was playing CDs again. I can also play CDRs now, something my stereo hasn't been able to do for six months

When you first look at this cleaner one can't think how simple! It looks like a Compact Disc with tiny brushes on it. My CD player was not playing correctly. After using the cleaner it works perfectly. Great product

Before I had this, I had a generic cassette adapter.  The sound was horrible and it made a terrible, tinny echo.  I bought it for my Ford Taurus which costs $800 to add a CD changer to.  My wireless FM adapter sounded better than my generic cassette adapter, and it was static city since the antenna is on the opposite side of the car (station wagon).

I was pleasantly surprised when I got this adapter to replace my old one.  The sound quality is better than the strongest FM station here, and the coiled cord really reduces the mess in my car.  I only had one problem with this, and I think that is because of my car stereo, but I will note it anyway.

After 10 minutes of playing, my car stereo would switch to side 2, then side 1, and display TDE1 and eject the tape.  After getting very angry, I found a solution.  Simply take the adapter apart, spray WD40 on all the gears, and remove the small gear assembly that prevents the rape from being rewound (was this even necessary? there is no physical tape so it doesn't matter if someone tries to rewind it).  Problem solved!

I would definitely get this over any other adapter

I was so excited about how great this product worked when I got it.  I had purchased the FM transmitter for my wife and they do not work so great so I thought since my car had a tape deck I would give this a try.  I was excited that I had all my ipod music with me, BUT after less than a week it the sound  started going down hill to a point where I couldn't listen anymore with it.  It is now in a landfill somewhere.  My guess is I will need a radio in the car that is ipod compatiable cable.  For now just have the radio and CDs I burn

Somebody was thinking when they designed this adapter. The plug that works for either style cassete player, the one where the small end of the cassete goes in first, or the one where the wide side goes in first. Plus the curly cord that doesn't get in the way. The big bonus is the price, it's half the cost of the Monster adapter, and it works great. The reviews of the Monster adapter are very poor. I first bought a DLO Transpod 2 FM Transmitter, big mistake. The sound was about 80% static as there wasn't any line of sight between the Transpod and the car antenna. If you have a car where the antenna is molded into the rear window, it probably would work better. Anyway this adapter and my iPod sound great over my car stereo. There are a few car cassette players that won't work with a adapter, if one adapter doesn't work, none will

I agree with the others that have provided a favorable review.  I am pleasantly surprised with many aspects of the product.  It feels like a quality product.  It is very quiet in the player having only a light sound of "clicking", which does not impair the reproduction of the music.  The sound is very clear and not distorted.  I am very pleased with it.

It's very convenient and simple to use - gets job done & makes the car ride so much smoother. Maybe it seemed a little quiet, but that depends on the volume adjustings... I might buy another for the other car. And, its value definitely exceeds the price that I paid. :

I used to buy Energizers and Duracells at $3-4 a pop for four batteries.  Now I buy generic Alkalines at Costco.  Cost: $8 for 10 four packs.  It's like having a battery store in the kitchen drawer.  According to a recent coprehensive story in Consumer Reports, there is only a little difference between name brand and generic alkaline batteries

These are by far, the best batteries you can get. They last 5 times longer than standard Alkaline batteries, they look cool, and they weigh almost nothing. You'll love being able to save lots of cash by not constantly  running to the store for batteries, and the fact that your portable  electronic will weigh less! I've used these numerious times in many  different electronic devices, and I LOVE THESE BATTERIES! TRY THEM! You  won't be sorry

I really like this key board.  I find it to be verys responsive and unlike some other reviewers I haven't found that I have to press the keys and longer or harder then I do with a normal keyboard. I often leave a gaming keyset on even when I'm not playing.

My only complaint is that there is not a good instruction manual.  I got this keyboard mainly to play WOW. As anyone knows there are many commands in that game and in that respect the learning curve to fully use my keyset has been a little high.  I also have the Age of Empires III keyset and I have the same complaint.

All in all I am very happy with this product.  I only wish it had better support

I ordered the keyboard and BF2 keypad combo for $53.
The BF2 keyset comes from Tigerdirect and shipped immediatly.
The Zboard shipped from Amazon took a week to ship and 11 days to arrive??!!
ummm.. someone explain this one to me? amazon?

The product is great tho-it has all the necessary keys. believe me, Ive tried the merc, nostromo2, and the zboard Fang, all of those didnt have critical keys. like change vehicle position or camera, or map.
But for some reason on all their zboard units they swap enter/exit with cycle weapons. E with F. WHY?? I liked enter/exit where it was and was used to it. I never used cycle weps, i would just hit the number key for that wep or scroll the mouse (both faster), *sigh* I wish these guys would just quit thinking they know better how to lay out my controls.
They could just give us a pad of some sort with all map-able keys and let us set it up to suit us, but they have to muck it up. At least just leave the keys postions alone guys.

 The ZBoard is the next best thing to having a voice activated keyboard that writes for you. Its great for anything you want to do. If your a gamer, get this keyboard, it has changeable keypads for all the best new games and it helps a lot! If your new or experienced this is a great keyboard. And the best part is, it works for typing as well. The ZBoard has a layout specifically . designed for typing AND searching on the web so it's good for everyone not just hardcore gamers. I love this keyboard.

The Good:
When I first heard about this board I was incredibly excited.  I have been playing BF2 (Battlefield 2) for almost a year now and still continually find myself stumbling over the keys. So it was a godsend to be able to purchase something like this directly intended to help me be better at my game. 

The interchangable keysets for different games and applications is quite intriguing -- the first that I have seen.  But the price for each is kind of high but well worth it.

The Bad:
The board is constructed well but don't expect this to replace your home keyboard.  The "Windows Keyset" that comes standard with this board has all the keys as any run-of-the-mill keyboard but it is awkward to type with (I might be biased since I have a MSoft ergonomic split keyboard). 

In-game typing is difficult at best (with the gaming keysets). With most of the gaming keysets the keys on the left 1/2 of the keyboard are laid out like your home keyboard but on the right 1/2 side they are all vertical (not staggered.. like U,J and M  keys are 90 degrees vertically on top of each other). The keys feel a little "cheap" .. When you push them down they don't bounce back as much.

The Ugly:
About 2 weeks after I purchases this board (and the BF2 keyset) 9 keys went completely dead.  I tried to reinstall the software, reboot and even resinstalled a fresh copy of Windows XP to no avail.

I contacted support and it has taken us 3 weeks to finally reach the decision that I have a faulty base unit. DUH!  They are "reviewing my warranty" but most likely it will not be covered because it has been longer than 30 day. Maybe this post is premature but I don't think I am getting a new base unit.

Conclusion:
The expression "Great Idea, Bad Execution" holds true here. My opinion: Don't buy this board. Ideazon has too many issues, not enough support staff and a website that doesn't do anything but look good

This is a very good keyboard for games 'cause it's cool to have bigger directional keys, very comfortable. It's kinda hard at the beginning to type because now u have like a reduced version of ur keyboard in the right side, but it's just a matter of time and practice. Very good keyboard, I really like it

The Z-Board is great. But If you are playing Battlefield 2 and then switch to the ZBoard you are in a fix. The controls are totally different and very hard to get use to. If you start with it, it might be alright but I think the regular keyboard will be just fine

I purchased the  Zboard after seeing it for sale in the store.  I have long wanted a keyboard that made gaming easier and this seemed to fit the bill.  The keyboard is easy to use with its interchanging lay overs for normal qwerty style typing or its many custom game styles.  Although it took a little getting used to a first, I have found that gaming goes smoother and easier now.  Equally important, no more mistaken keyboard keys being hit while in active, bullets flying, bombs bursting, combat.  I have used the Battlefield 2 set and qwerty set.  The only downside to the keyboard is that if you intend to type a message while gaming, you will get really screwed up trying to figure out where the keys are now located on the keyboard.  I try to use the in-game speech channels instead of typing.  Was it worth the money?  Yes certainly after I bought it on Amazon.com where the cost was lower, so after shipping I saved a couple of bucks under the suggested retail price on the company web site (and no shipping expense on top of that)

Well constructed and worked right out of the box.  We are anxious for more gaming templates.

How about templates for MS Flight Simulator and the different planes?

The player stopped working after only a few months - it would accept DVDs but not play them and refuse to eject them.  That behavior started out as intermittent, but it finally gave up the ghost and swallowed a DVD and never let go.  We had to take the player apart just to get the DVD out before throwing the player away in the trash.  Our previous DVD player lasted over 5 years before it started skipping.  This one lasted less than a year before it stopped working altogether - what a waste.  Save your time and money and buy another machine

I bought this DVD player after my Sony player died prematurely.  Is it just me, or are DVD players supposed to have a longer life??  This DVD player looks nice and works fine when it is working.  The player is a bit noisy when reading the discs, though.  But the bottom line is that it just stopped working after only 1 year of use.  I expected an improvement over my Sony player and I am sorely disappointed

I bought one...  Just bought 2 more.   This DVD player is a gem for the money.  I'm on a very busy schedule so I can't verify what I'm going to say here, but I belive I'm playing HD on this unit.  I downloaded some  HD clips thru bittorrent and usually have to play these on my pc connected to the HD monitor.  I copied these AVI and MPEG clips to a dvd, popped them in this player and watched outstanding clear HD quality vid on my HDTV monitors.  I don't know if there is some upscanning or down scanning going on between this dvd player and my NORCENT 32" HDTV, but my eye is seeing 1080 resolution and images so sharp I cna see the goose bumps on an olympic swimmer.   
 
I don't know about reliability, but there's junk in all batches of china made electronics.  But if this player was sold for $[...]  I would still buy one of them after seeing hd quality content on my monitor. 
 
I'd say unless you're spending your last $[...],  buy this unit and take a chance on the claimed quality issues here.  I'm sold!

We bought this powered hub for a desktop because some of our devices were not being recognized as USB 2.0 and we finally tracked the problem down to a power issue.

The D-Link was immediately recognized by Windows XP.  Further, TWO devices, that previously registered individually as USB 1 when connected directly to a USB port, were immediately shown as USB 2 when both were simultaneously connected to the hub.

The price was right as is the performance.  We recommend it

I had been using a Belkin F5U021 4-Port hub. My computer was constantly reporting Low USB power, I'd have to unplug something to get something else working. Since I replaced it with the D-link. No more Low USB messages; No more un-plugging.
As a matter of fact I had previously replaced my LinkSys router (which I had to reset from time to time) with a D-Link. I've never had to reset the D-Link.
Obviously, D-Link makes very good products.
I highly recommend D-Link products

I've had this hub for two months and have had no problems with it. Installation was a snap, as it should be for a basic hub. The hub is small and a bit too light, but it's definitely not for laptop users, as it needs an AC adapter.  The power brick is actually smaller than most other brick-style adapters and rises straight up from the prongs, saving you space on power strips that have the plugs aligned vertically or on wall outlets (a nice touch). I have an iPod and a multifunction printer attached to the hub, and have had no problems with either.  A word of warning, however--as other reviewers have noted, if you plug a USB 1.0 device into the hub, all USB 2.0 devices will slow down to 1.0 speeds

This is very well designed. It give you 4 USB Port but two on opposite sides. This is very clever becase you have plug in devices from both sides. You webcam or cell on your left and your mouse and number pad on your right. The cord that plug in from the Hub to the Computer is very sterdy yet flexible so you can not only adjust the Hub in all kind of angles, it would stay at that angle and not twist all around you wires. It also works great if you jsut want to charge you USB devices on the go. It come with a plug in AC adapter so you don't need to bring your computer along with you to charge youd devices

I,ve seen complaints about the ac adapter you "must" plug in. Hey guys, try it without an outside energy source, I just hope I,m not gonna fry something but it seems to work fine just plugged into a powered USB port. I have a VERY high end system though with wattage to sprare, but no more PCI slots, Damn 7900 512 gtx graphics cards, why do 2 of em have to take up so much room. Oh well, trade offs are a bi---, but a reality and 7 extra USB slots are awfully nice

This review pertains specifically to the Targus PAUH217U 4 Port Ultra Mini USB 2.0 Hub. 
The cord is about 2.5 feet long - long enough to reach from my pc, which sits on the ground, to the top of the desk. It has a cable which is split into two USB plugs - one just to transmit data, the second to power the unit. The second plug does not need to be used unless you plan on using some heavy-duty hardware, and if so what are you buying a hub called the ultra mini for anyways? If you insist on trying to run a blow dryer off the thing, then it does have an input for a separate power source, which you will have to buy separately. 

In short, If you have an old school machine with USB ports which are inaccessible /inconvenient to use, this little hub will give you quick access while taking up minimal space on your desk

I would like to believe that this hub works well- but I wouldn't know.  I bought it to reduce clutter on my desk from all my devices hooking into my powermac.  I hooked up my printer, ipod and digital camera and nothing happened.  I called Targus and they said I needed an a/c adaptor.  It doesn't come with one and doesn't say anything about one in the manual or instructions, or their website.  They said I could get it at radio shack and gave me the info (5 volt, 2.1 amp, center positive).  I've been to two radio shacks and online- they don't carry it.  I'm upset.  Any advice

It's speedy and space saving and inexpensive. I bought this to replace my Belkin because the Belkin needed to be plugged in. This one is powered by your computer so there's no extra power cords, which is a big plus to me. 

The only thing I dislike about this is the fact that the Hub takes up two Usb ports instead of just one like the Belkin.

PROS

Small
Cute
Self-powered - comes with a power adaptor.  I have 6 devices hooked up to it, including 2 USB Hard Drives, and it works fine without the adapter - a big plus for me. Most hubs would not work with this setup.
USB 2.0 & 1.1 - 6 devices hooked up, 3 low speed and 3 high speed, all work very well.
Runs cool.

CONS

Not sure why, but they put the 7 ports on one side of the hub and power/uplink ports on the other.  This is dumb.  If you have the hub on a desk it looks awkward.  All ports should be on the back and leds on the front.  Here, the leds are next to each port which makes them completely useless as you don't see them.  
The hub is very light so when you have lots of devices hooked up the font gets a elevated.

Overall, the best hub I've ever had and I tried many

It's a simple device, so there's not to say about it other than it does the job. You should note that the LEDs on the device remain lit as long as the device is plugged into your PC and the PC is powered (they glow a bright blue).

You will appreciate this product only if you don't have enough USB ports. In my case, I had plenty of ports, but needed an extension cable, which would help me in plugging the flash drives, whithout bending down and plunging into the cave of wires(I keep my CPU, under the table).The only complaint I have is the the wire lenght is not long enough.
Overall good value for price

This hub takes care of old power issues I had with smaller (unpowered hubs).  It is handling my pda, usb jump drive, high capacity external drive, and printer.  And I still have 3 more ports.  And I haven't had any USB power alerts from my computer since I added this hub.  It does what it says

I've had it for about 2 months already, and it has worked without any flaws. The only thing you have to be aware is to use good media to burn audio cds and MP3, because if not it will skip seconds while playing.

But other than that, sound is perfect and it has lots of power for it's size.  You won't go wrong with Panasonic

This Panasonic is all right, except I would die to get my old Sony system back.  They just don't have the sound quality at Panasonic that Sony had with these small systems.  I don't like that I don't have a clock display at all times and sometimes the CD changer is confusing to me, but it will just take time to figure it out.  Since these kind of bookshelf stereos are becoming more obsolete, I am happy to have this one.  With all the sound quality of the Sonys I have owned (I've gone through a half dozen) it will please me if this just hangs on and does not become a disappointment in functionality.  I would like this one to hang around longer.  Hopefully, the CD reader will not go out like my Sonys did

I bought this model in order to be rid of my almost-new Sony MHCEC70 with its faulty ergonomics and detestable tuner.  Having once owned an earlier PM-series model, this new Panasonic was the obvious choice and it does not disappoint.  Like its predecessor, the PM53 is a nice, powerful compact stereo with (for the money) ridiculously nice audio quality and a good tuner, especially on the FM band.  It can easily be turned up load enough to cause hearing damage and annoy neighbors in adjacent houses.  The remote covers every function and is easy enough to figure out without consulting the manual.  

Right now, this is the budget stereo of choice for the discerning.  Sony's competing models are cheesy-looking (hog attention on store shelves,) bigger (i.e., take more materials/cost more to ship,) and consequently suffer certain cost-cutting measures like the aforementioned crappy tuner and simplified (and of course, proprietary) antenna connector.  It's like choosing between the Pontiac and the Toyota.  The Sony is for the unwashed rubes who want 300 watts of mylar-coated bling.  The Panasonic is for people who want something that makes pleasant sounds and looks like the rest of the furniture.

It was very easy to put together and takes up minimum space.  However, the sound is not minimal and is great for my needs.  I particularly like the equalizer for both my pop and classical music.  The radio, with the antenna, has great sound with little static.  The cd player is great for my needs; easy to play just one cd or the entire deck.

My only quibble is that it has a single cassette deck and is not auto reversible.  But that's a small price for having a system with great sound.  

Instruction book, as most books are, could use a little ironing out but I was able to get started and if you have set up a shelf system before, this should be a breeze.  If you haven't set one up before, you should have no trouble

I mainly bought this for its reliability, # of outlets and (most of all) the CleanPower feature.  Funky / dirty AC power is one of the leading causes of shortened life expectancy for electronics.  Some things I noticed:

Yes, it is plastic, but it has that good, thick plastic feel, NOT the cheap thin stuff that seems like it would crack when dropped.

It can be hung in virtually any direction (horiz, diag, vert) from two screws/nails by two plus-sign (+) hole patterns on the back of the unit.

The cord is long and thick.  The plug is a wall-hugging 90-degree angle type that can be used in either the top or bottom outlet receptacle.  Huh?  It is not only wall-hugging but it doesnt hang straight down from the receptacle - imagine you plugged this into a clock face: the plug would be angled toward the "4" or "5" on the face so that you aren't limited to plugging it in the bottom plug.  You could actually have two of these plugged into the same outlet.  Enough about that...

The plug connectors are REALLY tight fitting.  You'll see what I mean when you go to plug in the computer or whatever.  ALL Monster outlets are this way, and are intended to help keep the plug from falling out or being ripped out by accident.  Another way Monster Cable thinks about the small things that bug us.

Mine came with a phone cable that was a couple feet (or so) in length.  Cool, now I can plug the fax through the connectors on the unit.  (Nothing to report there.)

The power switch lights up in red.

Comes with labels to help indentify BOTH ends of the power cabes you are plugging in.

The three "transformer" positions are great for those old box plugs for the cameras and such.  Plenty of room built in.

I HIGHLY recommend this unit for your computer

This is the 3rd surge plug that I have purchased.  The first one met an untimely death do to a major water spill from a fish aquarium, but all the equipment attached to it survived.  All in all, these plugs are the best.  Each plug is labled and you get tags to label your cords (a nice feature if all your plugs are same color and style).  the added area for power packs is a nice touch as those take up so much room

It is worth the $$$$. I hooked up all my electronics to it. The plugs are held extremely tight, and they will not fall out. The picture on my Monitor is less shaky. Also, the cord on it is extremely long, and the plug is almost flat to the wall. It is also a great deal because it comes with labels for the wires, and locking cable ties. I have bought one for my PC, and TV

I just bought a new computer and I new if I ever needed a new surge protector, monster would have what I need.  This baby has it all.  Clearly marked, 3 prong, plugs for the computer, monitor, printer, scanner, modem,  speakers and two extras...  It also includes phone line protection from  impulses and discharges caused from surge pulses (you need this!  without  this, I've lost two modems from storms 30 minutes away!).  It includes a  since 8ft long power line which is heavily insolated.  Other bonuses  include the 1665 joule rating, the 24k gold contact grounded plug, little  stickers to mark your cables with and a Monster phone line cable.  I also  like its attractive look.  Most are white and stand out.  Since this model  is black, it appears a little secluded on my desk.  But that's not all.   You're backed with a grantee this baby will not fail.  If it does, you are  covered my Monster's insurance!  That's worth 50 bucks alone

I can neither rate nor review this item, because I just realized I have to have two of them to use it.  They call it an intercom system, but it is really only half a system.  Amazon says there are only two left, so if this seems to be what you are looking for, better buy both. I bought a second one tonight

These Xtreme cd cases STINKs,literally! I don't know what kind of plastic material they are using and if they are toxic, but the smell is absolutely nauseous. I kept it for two weeks hoping the smell would go away. Nope. Finally I threw it away.

This card is the 2 GB Ultimate 120X  It has a tested write speed 120 times 150kb/sec which exceeds 18 mb per second.  Frequently card manufacturers advertise their read speed, which is always much faster. Analyze your file size for pictures you take and the speed in mb/sec will tell you how many of those pictures you can store in one second.

That impacts time between pictures. For cameras, write speed is the most important, but the speed rating of the card doesn't necessarily tell you its write speed.  For music players and other devices, read speed may be more important.  So you might choose a different card depending on whether you intend to use it to play music or take pictures.  I'm currently shopping for SD cards for a camera with the capability to shoot 3 pictures per second with large file sizes.  In order not to slow the camera down, I need a fast card.  I have done some research and realized that the reviews here aren't necessarily even related to this particular card, but are for all different sizes and speeds of Kingston cards. Kingston has been in the memory business for a long time and they are conservative in their ratings.  This card is #1 on my list right now because of its tested write speed

This card is the 2 GB Ultimate 120X  It has a tested write speed 120 times 150kb/sec which exceeds 18 mb per second.  Frequently card manufacturers advertise their read speed, which is always much faster. Analyze your file size for pictures you take and the speed in mb/sec will tell you how many of those pictures you can store in one second.

That impacts time between pictures. For cameras, write speed is the most important, but the speed rating of the card doesn't necessarily tell you its write speed.  For music players and other devices, read speed may be more important.  So you might choose a different card depending on whether you intend to use it to play music or take pictures.  I'm currently shopping for SD cards for a camera with the capability to shoot 3 pictures per second with large file sizes.  In order not to slow the camera down, I need a fast card.  I have done some research and realized that the reviews here aren't necessarily even related to this particular card, but are for all different sizes and speeds of Kingston cards. Kingston has been in the memory business for a long time and they are conservative in their ratings.  This card is #1 on my list right now because of its tested write speed

I was attracted to this remote by the web programming interface: I have friends who have to hold their remotes head-to-head and program each command one at a time, and then build the macros.  By contrast, I was able to configure my system even before I bought the remote (there is a trial SW available on the Harmony web page which took me 15 minutes to set up once I had a list of my devices): once I had the Harmony box opened, it took me about 4 minutes to start using it to control my TV, DVD etc since the web site remembers your setup.  A couple of commands did not work right away, so I ended up having to add them in individually ("Exit" and "OK" were not correct in the Harmony database for my Panasonic TV).  I also noticed that the cradle does not contact well, but it's easy to see when contact is made, and it doesn't take much to adjust it.  Besides, the remote doesn't need charging all the time - only once a week for moderate usage.

Even my gadget-phobe wife loves this remote - just having one remote is a joy for her.  And trust me, web-programming of the remote is the way to go.  I'm only pissed that there is now a $30 rebate, like the week after I bought mine

What a crock as it looks like everyone else got good product and good service!  I got a shuffle and something happened the second time I tried to load music to make it not even play.  I took it to the Apple Store in Mall of America (Minneapolis, MN) and they claimed to know there was an issue and claimed to have fixxed it.  I go back home (OK) and it still does not work.  Apple said for $113 they'll fix.  Gee thanks!  I'll be looking at another brand!  Apple stinks

The Sandisk 2GB SD is a high-quality name-brand product. It holds up very well to everyday use. The plastic casing and write-protection button is very solid - not flimsy or cheaply made like some other brands in this price category. In August 2006, I bought two SanDisk 2GB cards (new $30 each) as extra memory for my Palm TX PDA, and they work great for storing pictures, video files, backup data and programs. I also use them every day with a USB adapter for backing up PC files and transferring data to and from home and work. They work flawlessly.

Before I bought the SanDisk, I had a bad experience with a Corsair 133x 2GB card (about the same price), which had a little faster read/write speed than the SanDisk, but it was so cheaply made that it started falling apart within 2 months, including the write-protection button which fell off when I plugged it into my SD reader slot (Arrrgghhh!)

I have been very pleased with the SanDisk 2GB SD, and at $30 (new), I believe it's the best buy for the money. One web search will show you that this card sells (new) all over the place for more than twice this price. And oh yeah... stay away from "used" cards... who knows where they've been or how long they've been used. For me, it's not worth it to take a chance with my data on a used card. I hope this review helps. The SanDisk 2GB SD (new) is a smart choice

After only 3 months the SanDisk Cruzer Micro 2GB died.  Data was lost, could not be read.  Both my desktop and laptop computer wanted to reformat the Cruzer, but when I tried to format, it could not. Flash drive is totally useless. I replaced it with a Kingston Data Traveller and I hope it lasts longer.

I`ve got iHome for Christmas last year and I still love it! I read the reviews that IHome doesn`t work well ... well READ the instructions first !! It works perfect for me, the alarm, the radio the iPod - everything is just right. I am a light sleeper too, I could never fall asleep with the light on but this one doesn`t bother me at all ! Just learn to use it first-its easy. I also like the size of it, its not to small not to big, great to put on your nightstand and wake up to it  - to your iPod, radio or buzzer. I recomend iHome highly

</reviewer_location>
<review_text>
I got this player from Wal-Mart for about $72 after tax.  I like the long battery live, I didn't have to change the battery after 3 or 4 days of usage.

The only bug I hate is when I transfer audio tracks from my PC to the player, it changed some title and artist's name for few tracks (each transfer is on few different tracks).  Since you can't make any changes when the sound tracks is on the player, nor can you set a "playlist" on the player, so when I transfer an audio book to the player, it is not playing in the order of the chapters for the book.  Because of this bug, I have to double check the title name every time after a transfer and write down the tracks that the name has been changed and later on manually play the tracks in the order of the eAudio book.

I assume people use this player for individual soundtrack doesn't care about this, but for me and people who use it for playing eAudio book will hate this player

I've had my SanDisk for about 2 months now, and I love it.  I only use it while working out, so I wanted an inexpensive alternative to an Ipod.  Ipods, in my opinion, are over rated and too expensive, especially if, like me, you would only use it less than an hour a day.  I know several people who have had so many problems with their Ipods.  I have had no trouble at all with the SanDisk.  It comes with an armband, and plastic protective case to prevent the screen from getting scratched.  Its a great little player if you can't afford the hype of an Ipod

One of the most essential buttons on any remote is the Channel + button and it did not work straight out of the box.  I returned it.

Beyond that, setting it up takes time but is not difficult.  I am just going to wait and see about the next model that comes out

I have had mine for over 2 1/2 years. Im a painter I work with lots of loud machines all day, from my paint sprayer to the sander. these buds are very good. they are comfortable enough to wear all day I generaly work 8-12 hrs a day and use them for at lest 6-8 hrs. they have one of the best sounds i have had out of a headphone. I bought some boss ear buds a while back and that were over $100.00 but the sound difference was not worth the extra cash i forked out. the long cord can be anoying ive just learned to cary a small ruberband with me and tuck the extra into the pocket with my ipod.and if you wear the headpones with the wire behind your head it dosnt bother you at all. I dont know what people are saying about the wires rubbing and making noise. mine dont. you should buy them. save yourself some cash.

Well ill have to keep this review short as its getting late.
This is actually the first TV that i have taken to write a review for (Its Currently 12:19AM so my spelling might be a bit off)

Alright enough of the pointless talk, here is my review.
Oh by the way the S4 of this TV is out. (New Color Wheel) its called the HL-S4266W which has a new Color wheel.

Upon first reading about this TV i was a bit skeptical. The whole "The Shell on the bottom of the screen when your seeing black on the scrren." First of all you do see a little what looks like a white shell on the bottom of ths screen. However is is barely noticable unless your trying to pick it out (Had my friend try to find something wrong with the screen when it was all black and he had problems finding the "Shell")

When i was buying a TV i needed one that was less the 40" in width because my wall unit is only 40" wide. So i was looking at a lot of Plasma's and LCD's but all of them were around 41-45" because of the side mounted speakers. This TV however was 39.3" wide which fit perfecly in the space. At first i hooked up my Xbox360 to the system with my friend and booted it up. The TV makes a chime sound which is a little catchy but not positive nor negitive in my opinion. I get to the Xbox screen, set it for 720P/Widescreen. So i start playing a game and my first reaction was it looked like crap compared to my Sony 60" WEGA Tv. After my friend left I was looking over at the Xbox and figured out that the video cable was switched to EDTV instead of HDTV. When i switched it to HDTV i saw a HUGE differnce. The picture was really really sharp and the TV is VERY bright which is good for movies and games. I am really happy with the purchase of this TV and i would reccomend it to anyone that is looking for a good cheap Hi-Def TV.

Pros:
 - Looks amazing if you feed it a High-Def source.
 - Very nice and bright if you want to play games or watch movies.
 - The interface is very clean and neat. (Not importaint but i like it)
 - It is a very nice looking TV compared to some others i saw at Bestbuy.
 - I like the speakers at the bottom of the TV. It gives the screen a very clean and nice cut.

Cons:
 - This TV brings out details from bad sources such as a standard DVD Player (I would just purchase a Upconvert DVD Player which outputs to 720P and you will have a amazing picture)
 - The Bulb will burn out in about 2-4 years (Depending on use

I have a PNY disk.  Shortly after the purchase I started getting "Memory Card Error".  It lasted intermittently for another month then died.  This is a sure sign of poor quality control.  I bought PNY because it was slightly cheaper than the other disks.  I suggest investing your money elsewhere.  It is worth the extra $$$ to save your precious information

 I just recieved my brandnew 256mb SD memory card from newegg a few hours ago. It came in factory packaging and I know is brand new. Immidiatly upon putting it in my card reader it said "card read error" I have put it in serveral other computers and cameras in an attempt to format it, this card is shot and i JUST GOT IT. This is not the first PNY 256 to do this to me, i gave one away previously in frustrastion thinking it was my computer, it was not. I tried to call there tech support but at first it gave me only the option of where to buy their products when i called again it was closed and offered no info on SD memory. I went online and looked for support for SD but wouldn't you know they don't have any FAQs on it. I tried to write them an email on it but there mail server crashed and my 10 minutes of typing to there tech support was in vein. I have read that many others have recieved cards that didn't work when they got them or failed after 1 or 2 erase cycles. IN SHORT don't by PNY, spend the extra money and get something that will work, if it doesn't work i don't think tech support will help you, if you want to roll the dice and take a chance and something that probably wont work than PNY is for you. If you don't believe me call their tech support 18002344597, you try to ask them about there fine SD memory, go to their website to, see what they have to say about there fine products, spend the 5 minutes to look into it before buying it on impuls

This card is the 2 GB Ultimate 120X  It has a tested write speed 120 times 150kb/sec which exceeds 18 mb per second.  Frequently card manufacturers advertise their read speed, which is always much faster. Analyze your file size for pictures you take and the speed in mb/sec will tell you how many of those pictures you can store in one second.

That impacts time between pictures. For cameras, write speed is the most important, but the speed rating of the card doesn't necessarily tell you its write speed.  For music players and other devices, read speed may be more important.  So you might choose a different card depending on whether you intend to use it to play music or take pictures.  I'm currently shopping for SD cards for a camera with the capability to shoot 3 pictures per second with large file sizes.  In order not to slow the camera down, I need a fast card.  I have done some research and realized that the reviews here aren't necessarily even related to this particular card, but are for all different sizes and speeds of Kingston cards. Kingston has been in the memory business for a long time and they are conservative in their ratings.  This card is #1 on my list right now because of its tested write speed

Excellent performance, I've been using it for 3 months now, nothing (even earphones) is broken. I bought it from a retail store. The first one malfunctioned. I returned for this one. Works perfectly ever since.

And for folks want a large storage MP3 player (1-2GB), think again, if you just want an MP3 player, then go for a 512 MB one because 

1. There's a high chance for large-storage MP3 player to malfunction. Period.
2. You'll find a hard time surfing to find your one favorite song (512MB- 233 songs are pretty enough annoyance for me to go through the list). If you feel the lack of space, simply delete those songs you don't feel like hearing anymore.
3. If you're some type of lazy, then check the iPod section.

Additionally, this is not some flashy things functioned as jewelry for "stylish" boys and girls, if you wanna look "hot", again, try the iPod section. This player is for pratical use.

At first I was happy to be able to purchase a printer for such a low price.  However, the price should be even lower for this pile of junk.  Every time I attempt to print, I spend several minutes trying to feed it paper.  The printer will intake several pieces of paper at the same time instead of just one, and it will jam up.  Even if I just feed it one piece of paper at a time, it will often still jam on just one piece of paper.  Printing should not be this hard.  These problems have occurred since I first purchased the printer.  I regret purchasing this printer, as I should have went with a higher end model.  I've lost respect for HP products because of the poor quality of this printer

Extreme III is All That, for me and the family.Switching from RAW, and back so far is flawless. Temperatures seem to have no ill effect as long as I am using freshly charged batteries in extreme cold 32deg. or colder, no delay in summer conditions.
Since I purchased Extreme III 2.0 GB to use with my Canon Rebel XT camera, with 8MP this has been the best deal for my money.I could have bought cheaper CF cards; I believe you get what you paid for.I Purchased this CF Card after purchasing the SanDisk Ultra II 512MB. I only use the Ultra II as backup now, and likewise this still performs excellent.
My opinion; Great Price, Good deal.

This product only works for light scratches and greasy dirt and grime. It could be better if the polishing heads rotated at a much faster speed and applied more pressure.  The polishing fluid is also not very good.  Better is compound from an autobody paint store.  Acrylic is acrylic.  Essentially it lacks power.  I've polished to a shine deeply scratched cds and dvds using an automotive paint polishing machine.  

This tool is a waste of time and money. 

If they powered it up for $50.00 more than I would probably buy one.  Commercial cd polishers are available but for a couple of hundred dollars

It was a great product when it worked.  Sleek design, super user friendly, sharp image and easily unlock to all region.  Never had any problem loading or playing until last week.  Went completely dead for no reason in the middle of a movie.  Swallowed the DVD with it.  It would've been a greater product if it lived pass 1 year at least

When I first got the headphones (E3c) I tried all of the sleeves, trying to find a good balance between comfort, ease of use, and sound quality.  It is important with all of them to insert them correctly to get a good seal, and therefore good sound.

I really liked the Ultra-soft sleeves because they were simple to put in, had a good seal, and were confortable to wear.  Unfortunately they are so soft they slip off of the stem if they are in too deep.  This happened to me twice (I know, fool me once...)!  My wife had to get in there with tweezers to get them out.  I have read that I'm not the only one.  Others have had to go to the hospital to get them out.  Beware

The discs simply do not work. I have used them before with no problems, and I bought two of these packs, 100 discs total, and they were all bad. The technical support was a joke, who told me that since "you don't know what you're doing" they would send me to customer relations. I was on the phone with customer relations for just under a hour, talking to someone with the education level below 5th grade.

The 'customer relations' person talked to me sarcastically, put me on hold three times for over 10 minutes each time, and kept repeating over and over what the problem was. Eventually he told to send in all the discs, proofs of purchases that simply did not exist, and all of these was at my own cost, since they would not reimburse shipping. The representative kept inferring that I would never take him up on his offer. I wonder if anyone ever has. After that absolute horrific experience that simply cannot be boiled down into a simply paragraph, I will absolutely never buy anything that says Memorex on it for my entire life.

I've burned almost 100 Memorex 8X discs in four different PC DVD Burners.  Roughly 1/4 errored during the burn.  Of those that burned, over 1/2 pixelate and lock up when played on PC or home DVD player.  My firmware is up to date and I haven't had this much trouble with any other DVD-R except for Staples brand.  I give them 2-stars since they do work well in my home theater DVD Burners but only in Standard Play mode and at 1X burn speed.  In EP or faster burn modes, they pixelate.

I researched for a while trying to find a reasonably priced, reliable printer that works well and I think I've found it. The HP D4160 got pretty good reviews on various sites I looked at (including Amazon) and so I decided to purchase it.

The total price I paid, including shipping and a USB cable, was about $67. Setup was easy - I installed the drivers with no problem. Configuring the printer was simple, too. Once I was through with all of that, I took it for a test run. The print quality is pretty good. I didn't expect laser quality with the "Normal" setting, but at the "Best" setting, it's pretty close. Graphics came out pretty good, too. Another bonus is the well-priced ink cartridge replacements: $20 for black and $24 for color - these are the prices from HP's website.

So far, I'm enjoying the printer. I've only had it about a month and haven't done that much printing, but the printing I have done, I've been satisfied with. So, great quality for the price paid - I'd definitely recommend it

I picked up this printer for $48.99 including shipping... this printer prints extremely fast and the ink isn't an sticker shocker around $21 and change at most locations.  If you're looking for something reliable and cheap this is the printer for you.  I print around 2000 pages per day because of my job 5 days and  a week.  I haven't had any problems at all crosses finger

This printer has now been in service for a couple of months at my house.  It is extremely fast and performs with great print quality.  The grey scale reproduction is good, but not great.  Considering the price of this "GEM" from HP, the quality is outstanding

The HP LaserJet 1022 is a delight, especially for someone like me who was used to the much older HP Laserwriter TN series, a slower (though quieter) workhorse. The LaserJet 1022 is compact, efficient and easy to use. Others have complained of the printing noise levels, but I haven't found that to be an issue. The only small adjustment I've had to make is, because it doesn't have a paper drawer (like the older model I had), if paper isn't placed precisely in the feeder, it's a bit temperamental and, instead of printing, will make an irritating clicking noise. All in all, though, it's a great printer and a good value

I have used an HP LaserJet 1022 at my desk for the past nine months. I print about 75 - 100 pages per day average. I haven't had a single problem yet with the printer. I think it prints extremely well, hasn't jammed ever, and is one of the most reliable printers I've ever used!

I have been very impressed by this printer for the price.  It zips through pages and looks  a lot better than the Brother and Samsung purchased by our office.  I am using it on Mac OS 10.4.7 & 10.3.9, but installations at the office in 2 Dell XP Pro PCs went without a hitch.  The noise level strikes me as pretty quiet, especially compared to the old HP LJs that I used to support. 

If you do a lot of printing, step up to the LJ1320.  It's faster and has a 5,000 page cartridge availble that lowers toner cost to less than 2.5cents per page.  The 1022 only has a 2000 page cartridge available.  The 1320 goes on sale for  only a hundred dollars more than the 1022

I have had great experience with this printer.  I even bought a jet direct card for it, and and it works great.  I recently installed XP 64-bit only to find there were no drivers for this printer supported.  However, I used the HP4L driver and it works good enough for my purposes

...and I do mean it works. I'm planning to buy this printer for my home PC because I've been using this model daily at work for about 10 weeks. I print a high volume at work - approximately 1/2 a ream of paper every day over a 9-10 hour period. I use an entire toner cartridge about every 10 working days. The HP Laserjet 1022 has been a champ, printing mainly on standard printer stock, but also various Avery 8.5x11 label sheets - with multiple runs thru the printer, the occasional envelope, and some two-sided pages as well. The prints are uniformly crisp and clean until the toner begins to run out; by removing and shaking the cartridge, then re-inserting it, i've been able to get an extra day's printing out of each cartridge, roughly another 100-200 sheets. And it prints so fast!
I didn't set up the printer myself - our IT tech did; but it took him only a few minutes, and it's running fine on my WinXP Pro operating system; I expect it to run equally well on my Win2K Pro O/S at home

I bought this item for printing chemistry journal articles for graduate school. I wanted something reasonably fast and economical. I distinctly remembered as an undergrad trying to print a 30 page article on my HP PSC 2110 and waiting forever.

This seems like a good printer. Setup was a breeze. Envelopes are easily done, although it feels like they aren't as gracefully handled as in the PSC2110 (apples and oranges comparison, though). The printouts look great. I'm very pleased with my purchase. HP printers have never let me down.

Running Windows XP; SP2; on a single Gateway Profile computer. Microsoft Office 2003.

I read earlier reviews and it would appear that this printer either works for you and gets 5 stars, or doesn't work and gets 1 star. There is little in between.

We bought it about three months ago as a replacement for an old HP 4P that finally died.  The difference is remarkable.  The 1022 installed quickly (USB); has a small footprint; prints the first page of a job very quickly; is fast; relatively quiet; prints cleanly; handles paper well; does envelopes (one at a time).  But I would stress that we use it lightly, perhaps a few pages a day and I can't comment on how it would stand up under very heavy use. 

Note that a new cartridge is about 1/3 of the cost of an entire new printer.

Still, we recommend it

I'm so glad I DIDN'T give Apple $30 for the charger that should have come with the ipod nano! I was so mad that they treated their customers so poorly I refused to buy the charger from them. So after reading a lot of reviews on a few different chargers I picked this one. I'm really happy with it. It fully charged my ipod nano in no time at all, especially compared to charging it on my laptop.  For the price you can't beat it and the shipping was pretty fast. Great product, low price :

I got this product a while ago and I am still happy with it. It's great because number 1: It's cheap number 2: It charges my iPod faster then it would if I hooked it up to my computer number 3: it's great for traveling. Don't get it from Amazon, though, what they charge for shipping is outrageous. I suggest going to a store called Five Below, where they sell this same product for $4. I have bought and recieved the iPod with video two weeks ago. The charger worked well with this. 3 minutes, and it's fully charged. I highly recommend this for anyone with an iPod.

I bought this mic for $9.95 at Office Depot here in Nashville. I'd initially went in looking for Logitech's USB mic but they didn't have it Since this was their only desktop mic I bought it. It works fine right out of the box. Good for dictation, but thin sounding for recording vocals, guitars, etc. The reason I give it high marks is because it is clean sounding for the price, but the sound is so thin that I'd either have to beef up the sound with EQ and/compressors and move on to a better sounding, more expensive, mic. I am confused, though, as to why Cyber Acoustics' package mentions DC power 1.5v to 10v. This mic is not battery operated, so is the mic emitting 1.5v to 10v of DC power, or is it somehow receiving DC voltage from the 1/8" jack itself. In either case, the mic will do...for now

I guess I've been luckier than the other reviewers because I've had great luck with this microphone. I have it on my desk and I sit in my chair, sometimes reclining back, mouth a good 2 feet from the microphone. Using Dragon NaturallySpeaking 8 I get near-perfect accuracy with it - as good or better than any headset-mounted one I've ever used.

So I dunno folks. It's $10 and as low as $8 some places. It might be worth a shot if you're willing to exchange it for a better one if it doesn't work. It might work great and save you $20 over the $30 Logitech USB one that is supposed to be excellent. I'm glad I tried it, but cheap electronics do have a wider variance in quality than more expensive ones. I apparently got a great one, others got substandard ones

I have a Windows XP Home SP2. My wireless router is LinkSys.

I have a Dell C610 laptop that has built-in wireless, and a Dell desktop for which I purchased this TRENDnet PCI Adapter.

Installation was easy. I never shutdown my desktop, the next day there was no Internet connection. Upon checking the signal, it seemed to be at 80%. Repairing a connection did not solve the issue, the process hung. I had to restart the PC. Upon restarting the connection was fine. All the while my laptop was connected with no issues.

When I called TRENDNET helpdesk, the person told me that I was the only person who had this problem. He asked me to switch the card to another empty slot & call back. He hung up. 

I switched the card to another slot. Next day the connection was not there. I called helpdesk again. This time some other person asked me to download the latest driver. I did that, the problem did not go away.

I was given an RMA number, but now I have to pay for shipping to TRENDNET, I sent an email asking for an explanation. They explained that "they would pay for the shipping of the replacement". I was not pleased with this policy. Now I have to bear the burden of a defective product, not the company. I responded with a request for escalation to the management. So far it has been 10 days, and no response.

I am writing this review from my laptop, because the Internet connection from my Desktop is completely unreliable.

I give this 2 stars for (a) easy installation (b) toll free customer service with good hours

I will not buy a TrendNet product again

I've had no problems at all with this product. I don't get kicked off every 5 minutes like I did with my d-link wireless adapter. Also - it's easy to install and practially idiot proof. I was also very impressed with the shipping. I got it within a day or two. 

Overall, I'm happy with my purchase and will definitely repurchase from TRENDnet again

Buy the cheaper MDR-J10.  These are bulkier and don't stay in your ear as well as the J10.  The cheap clip-on device for attaching the cord to your shirt makes the headphones slip out of your ear even easier.  They last about as well as the J10s that I have owned in the past - they are already starting to fizzle/short out.  I have already purchased a set of J10s to replace these when they finally give up the ghost

Don't buy these. I don't have a problem with Sony, in fact, some of the other Sony headphones (like the MDR-J10) are much better. I used these running outside and at the gym and in no time they stopped working. And they sounded like garbage to start with. Oh, and since I am a forgiving person, I bought a second pair of the same thing to see if the first was a lemon. Nope. It's just a terrible product. They clearly couldn't take the abuse of some sweat. Junk. And they feel awkward. Get the cheaper MDR-J10. Much better. Lasted much longer through the workouts

I was very skeptical about purchasing these headphones, because the IPod earphones, and several sony earbuds hurt my ears after an extended period of time. These were much better than i thought. The  sound is clear, and a great sound for around 15 dollars.The cord slider is always a nice feature. And about them falling off, so far, i have not had any problem with them. They are very light, and very comfortable. You don't need to shove them in your ear liek the earbuds, and the weight is distributed to different parts of your ear, allowing you to wear them for extended periods of time, w/o them hurting.  I would ahve given it 5 stars, but the material used, could have been a little more flexible, which might cause the problem of falling off people are saying they are having. 
Overall, Great sound, and build for the price!

(3/18/06) I read lots of reviews in which people say their earphones fall off and are not worth anything.  I guess it all comes down to the shape/size of people's ears.  These fit my ears like a glove.  I don't even realize I am wearing them.  I'm currently traing to run a marathon; I run a lot.  So far, the farthest I've ran with them was twelve miles and I had not problems at all.  I only paid $10.00 for them; if they break, that's fine; the usage I've gotten out of them so far has been worth every penny (and I'm confident I will get many more miles out of them before I need to get new ones.)

ADDENDUM (8/18/06): Well now I have trained and run two marathons and the earphones are still holding up.  I am currently training for a third marathon (which is in two months) and these earphones have not given me any problems.  I am confident these earphones will be operating just fine in two months while I run the third marathon.  If/when they break, I will definitely gotten my $10-worth out of them.

ADDENDUM (10/15/06): I just ran the third marathon and these earphones are still good.  I wouldn't be surprised if these hold up for a couple more marathons

Through trial and error I have found that the headphones that wrap around each ear instead of the traditional band (over the head) style or earbud only style are best suited for very active work outs.  The problem for me was that a couple of the wrap around models that I tried did not do a good job of channeling my hard earned sweat away from my ear canal.  Sony has done a good job of incorporating their sport (water-resistant) over the head (band) style with the wrap around the ear style.  These headphones do a pretty good job of keeping sweat out of my ear canal, the wrap around allows me to be more active without having to adjust the headphones, allows me to more comfortably wear a hat...if I wish..and the earphones are more comfortable on my ears vs. having an ear bud stuck in the ear canal.  Amazon was about the only place I could find them though.  These are exactly what I was looking for

Although the sound is decent, I agree with many of the other reviewers' thoughts on these headphones.  They too often fall off the ear and when they do stay on are easily rattled around.  The clip is very awkward and only pulls the phones off the ear when one extends/rotates their torso.  Shortly after purchasing mine, the rubber-coating on one of the wires inadvertently split open, revealing the leads.  The sound was eventually lost in that earpiece.  I would suggest looking eleswhere for quality headphones for exercising

If I could give these negative stars, I would.  I bought these thinking they'd be great for the gym.  WRONG.  They continuously fell off, so often it was annoying not only me, but the girl on the treadmill next to me. Not only that, but the ten seconds they did stay on, they bounced around and made a rattling noise so loud, I couldn't even hear the music I was listening to.  I highly recommend you forget these duds.  I'm going to purchase another pair of Sony h.ear MDR-J20 headphones, which is what I bought these to replace because I slammed the car door on the cord of my original pair

I have purchased multiple iPods and they always die as soon as the warranty ends, I have many problems who have had the same experience. Apple has terrible customer services and basically tells you that you are SOL if you don't have an extended warranty. On top of that, although you are covered for one year, after a few months you no longer can recieve free customer service and they make you pay just to call and say that your iPod which is under warranty is broken needs to be replaced. I don't know if there is any other brand that works much better, but i'd suggest spending less money and buy a competitive product, atleast you won't feel ripped off because you paid so much more when it breaks.

The 40GB click wheel iPod I bought for my husband for Christmas last year died (hard drive fried) 360 days after he opened the box but one year and 3 weeks past when I bought it.  Appeals to an Apple Store and the "Apple Cares" (how's that for an oxymoron?) phone line fell on deaf ears.  They were unwilling to make any exception or provide discounts on a replacement, "...our warranty clearly states...from the date of purchase...".  So, in all caps, if you must buy an iPod, BUYER BEWARE! Think of this as a disposable purchase that will only last as long as the warranty

This IS the best thing since sliced bread! No wonder it was rated as last year's Best Invention. If you are like me and have a huge CD collection (literally 1,000's!) and your passengers in the car are sick and tired of carrying all your CD's on road trips, then wait no longer, the iPod is your lifetime solution. Not only is this thing made very durably (it's lasted me over a year now with no problems or repairs - even though it's taken a few drops and other minor beatings). The iPod is also great because it is light in weight, user friendly (so even you technology-illerate people will have an easy time getting started), aesthetically nice looking, and very easy to organize and store your music. I listen to a large variety of music (ex: bossa nova, jazz, classic rock, gospel, blues, classical, r&amp;b, house/dance music, etc....just to name a few) so it was so nice to be able to create as many playlists as I wanted for each genre of music I listen to! Whenever you play your music, there will be a display showing how many minutes have passed in the song and how many remain. Lastly, for those of you who insist on staying in the stone age with your PC's (MAC's truly ARE the new wave of the future!), rest assured, the iPod is compatible with PC's. I can't say enough great things about this thing. Do yourself a favor and buy one for a friend or family member. They will love you eternally for it

What a waste of money this product is; I've been using Linksys products exclusively for over 5 years for my home networking needs and have been very pleased with them all. This was my first negative experience, and I truly regret wasting money on it. I've had the NSLU2 for over 6 months now and it's never been reliable. It works OK as long you you're not using it (i.e. it stays up and running); it even works good with transferring one or two small files; but trying to move a large number of files (and by large I mean anything over 10-15 files) locks up both the NSLU2 and the computer the transfer is initiated from solid and required a hard boot of both. Deleting files from NSLU2 (or should I say via NSLU2) is also a crap shoot - sometimes it works and sometimes it just locks up. I'm so frustrated with it now that I'm starting to look for another alternative to replace it with and will send this one straight to the trash can as soon as I find something. Do yourself a favor and look for other options, even if they cost more - you'll just end up wasting money on this POS

I recently purchased this NAS device, (Network Attached Storage if you don't know it yet) and I connected a FAT32 formatted (yes, i was using the drive as is on my Windows laptop USB2 port before this, without any changes to it) drive to the device and switched on. 10 Minutes later I mounted the first drive letter after going through all the items in the manual, very basic steps on how to set it up.
I was not asked or required to re-format anything, and all the PCs in this family are now happily mounting drives off of this device.
The new firmware does not require ext2/3 or whatever anymore.
Remember, this device cannot work at the speed of USB2, since the 100Megabit networking used by most of us does not allow it to. The speed gives me functionality and flexibility, and this is what I wanted. I can live without the USB2 speed for now. This device works and works fast enough for most of us

There is a large hacker community out there coming up with more and more activities you can do with this very flexible device. It was an afternoon's work, but I, a person with moderate Linux skills, set up a Subversion version control system on this box (do a web search for "sprinkleofcocoa NSLU2" for a complete description of how to do this).  People have added serial ports, doubled the processing speed, and a good deal more. I can imagine driving laboratory equipment or model trains with this thing; the skies the limit.

I deducted a star because out of the box, the first one I purchased soon had its ethernet port break. And, I am not sure this box is particularly good at its primary function: file sharing, what with it's comparatively slow 100 Base-T Ethernet connection.

I apologize for the single star review.  There wasn't an option for no stars. 
Great concept, pitiful device.  Nowhere does it say that the external USB drives attached to this device will be formated differently than if they were attached directly to the USB port on your PC until you break the seal and get ready to connect.  They will only work on this device.
We got it set up and moved all the files we planned to share for our home business to it.  They were now easily accessible from any computer and life was great.  At least until we had to later move the adapter to another location in the office.  After turning it off and moving it, all of the data disappeared.  The file icon was still there but different.  The file size became -0-.  You'd think that once written they would remain.  Think again.  The files weren't being accessed like a flash drive when it was turned off.  They were WRITTEN. 
Do yourself a big favor and don't buy it

Would have been helpful to know that this doesnt work without the handset lifter. You push a button at your ear to access the phone line but unless the handset is off the hook, you dont get access. So your choices are to take it off the hook each time (which makes it not so wireless) or get the handset lifter as well that lifts the handset for you. Other than that i am very happy with the product. It has good reception, I can hear well and it has a nice range so you dont have to be on top of your phone for the handset lifter to lift the handset

works great for handsfree telephone and being able to work on the computer at the same time.  You can walk away from your desk and still talk on the phone.  The cons are that it does take up some room on your desk and it made from plastic.  It does serve its purpose though.  I use the over the head band because the behind the ear pieces are not comfortable

This Eton radio is the U.S. domestic version of the Chinese Tecsun PL-200 all-band pocket sized radio.  The Chinese version is legended in the native language and utilitarian in appearance.  The Eton is, well, in English with slight curves.  I have used and tested other Tecsun produced radios, including the PL-550 and the Grundig eTraveller VII.  Both are excellent radios, but this radio, which is quite portable and can fit into a shirt pocket, not a watch pocket, but a normal sized pocket, preserves the superperlative frequency discrimination of the much larger PL-550, as well as the ability to directly enter the frequency desired (if you know it), or scan through the AM, FM and many shortwave bands, find the stations you like and store their frequencies.  Closely allied, for example, FM stations within 200 kHz (only the strongest will be heard on most commercial FM receivers) of each other, can be picked up with clarity, positioning the manuverable whip antenna.  Very, very few radios, excepting expensive car radios, can boast such performance in the Unites States.  In addition, apparently, when headphones are connected, the radio uses their wires as well as the whip antenna - an uncommon feature in radios of this type - which permits retraction of the built-in telescoping whip antenna for all but shortwave and difficult to discriminate FM stations.  I had previously recommended the eTraveller VII, now discontinued, as the only decent all band radio that would fit in your coat pocket, but the Eton 100 and PL-200 beat it by a large margin, not the least of which their attributes being a lighted display so useful in not annoying significant others nearby in the darkness when one is addicted to listening at night.  Now on the market are other comparable radios, all made by Tecsun in China using the very same sophisicated reception circuitry regelated previously to expensive shortwave receivers.  In addition, for those weak, but interesting, FM stations that one can get on mono but with an obfuscating hiss on stereo, when one doesn't need stereo to just listen to, for example, the news, this radio has a mono-stereo switch.  This radio is simply excellent for its size and performance.  Alas, as with almost all radios this size, there is no single side band (SSB) reception, an enhancement that, defying digital technology, actually requires listener intervention to optimize and has great potential, but has, for the present at least, been consigned to the province of the technical listener more interested in ascertaining distant reception than actual broadcast information.  The Dalai Lama for all his 5,000 watts SSB from Tibet can not be heard on this radio. China Radio shortwave, at 150,000 watts, with Canadian relay stations, does just fine.  Australian radio, at the same power, Radio Havana, Radio Serbia, Croatia, Russia, Netherlands, Sweden, India, Israel, etc., at lesser power, and some with and most without relay stations, are also heard clearly on the Eastern seaboard during their times of broadcast - usually in the early evening EST

This radio works great!  It's compact and sturdy.  It has a lot of nice features.  The best one is the reception and digital tuning.  I have a favorite station on FM that is difficult to receive.  It's frequency is too close to a more powerful station.  This radio can single out my favorite weaker station.  I love it!

I use this radio mostly for newstalk; especially late at night with earphones so it doesn't bother my spouse. I like the configuration for station presets, and the simple "sleep timer power-on arrangement" which makes this radio easy to operate in the dark. Nice backlight when needed too.
AM and FM tuners are excellent. Pulls in favorite FM jazz station that comes in weak on our other portables. Haven't listened to a lot of shortwave, but we live in SF Bay Area and radio easily picks up Hilversum in the Netherlands, and stations sounding like PRC.
Radio speaker is not bad considering how small it is. Good headphones sound great. The included earbuds also sound good.
Case is solid with a nice bump resistant finish.
A bit pricey, but in my opinion it's worth spending a few extra bucks for this radio.

Hifolks ,I'm Vince the radioman . I have a large collection of radios and love to do compares and share my thoughts. First off the new Eton(Grundig) line of radios is a vast improvement over the old Grundig line , especially in the area of the construction of the body and antenna..nice job! This is a cute little radio . A nice addition to the better mini's out there. It has a robust memory and decent coverage but not full coverage . I compared it to the Sangean ATS606 and the SONY SW35 which are in the same price range and the old YB300pe. The 606 and the SW35 were more sensative on SW and AM . The FM was about the same. The YB300pe was not even in the same class as the others. It has a nice back light and comfortable controls and basic feel . Its really small and great for travel or the office . It does however need an wide/narrow switch and or an IF filter ... none the less and very decent , well made mini addtion to the new Eton line . I recommend buying this radio. .... a previous reviewer talks about the demise of SW listening ...I also grew up during the cold war and at the time SW was "exciting" and filled with info not available elsewhere. Lets just hope satellite and cable service hits a peak soon ...I have a feeling the world has not really explored the wonders of the radio spectrum and will again build up SW usage , also I have a feeling Pirate radio will grow on SW as the alternative to robot like satellite programing.  ....so if you do want to invest alot of money on a SW radio but want some access , this is a very nice choice.

Radio works fine for AM & FM but forget it if you want to use for shortwave listening.  There is no squelch so frequency scanning is worthless.  It just stops on every frequency.  The manual tuning dial is small and somewhat 'sticky', you will only use it to fine tune.  Shortwave reception isn't all that great.  I can put it next to a tabletop radio with built in antenna and the tabletop pulls in 75% more stations.  If you want a small AM/FM radio with alarm and are willing to pay $100, go for it.  Just don't expect much from the shortwave perspective

Coming from Romania, where listening to Voice of America and Radio Free Europe was religious in the communist era, I tend to overestimate the importance of shortwave radio and even worse, feel nostalgic about it. Spending the quiet hours of the evening tunig to God knows what stations freom God knows where is a pleasant thing to do, so reminiscent of the past. I have always loved to have a good shortwave radio and believe me, this tiny Eton e100 is much better than anything I ever had. It works. 

But I live in North America, a dead region to shortwave broadcasting. BBC stopped broadcasting here, and many others are moving to the internet only broadcasting. Owing a shortwave radio is hence useless, unless you dont mind catching some right wingsters that I dont understand how have decided to broadcast on shortwaves. 

Don't get me wrong, the radio catches some stations. From Austin TX I get radio Netherlands (not great but ok) , a few chinese stations (very clearly), radio Australia (very clearly). BBC though, Deutche Welle I have to say goodbye to. BUt my dream was to have a strong relay of the BBC, so I can put the radio on the table and listen to it, inside the house, as I used to when I was a kid. Now, I can get ALL these on the internet, so nostalgia for past aside, the little Eton e100 catches dust. 

And I did not even buy it for shortwaves: I bought it to have a good, not battery thirsty, clear radio in case a hurricane hits ... what a shame, isn't it?

This compact am/fm/sw radio is nicer than I expected.  The radio's size is ideal for pockets, so I frequently take it with me.  Currently I'm using up some excess alkaline AA batteries in my E100, but when they are gone, I will switch to rechargeable NiMH batteries.  (There's a system code you should set on the radio when switching between alkaline and rechargeable batteries - be sure to check the manual)

Positives:
* FM stereo through headphones sounds great
* Informative LCD display includes the frequency and the time while the radio is on (some other radios require a keypress to display the clock)
* Nice amber backlight for the LCD display
* Sturdy whip antenna
* It seems to be very easy on batteries

Negatives:
* Shortwave scanning using the up/down buttons is slower than on other shortwave radios I've used (e.g. Kaito 1102, Sony ICF-SW7600GR) - the radio pauses on each frequency longer than necessary
* Small buttons are occasionally difficult to press
* Tuning knob is only capable of fine tuning, i.e. it uses small tuning intervals and doesn't work as well if you try turning it very fast

I wouldn't recommend this radio as your only shortwave receiver, but only because other radios in this price range have more features.  My example would be the excellent Kaito KA1102, which offers features such as dual conversion, a wide/narrow bandwidth setting, single sideband reception, an included AC adapter, faster shortwave scanning, and backlighting for both the screen and keypad

This is loaded with every feature you could possibly want. It is a little bigger than a deck of cards. It is incredible how much is being packed into small radios these days. Am reception is acceptable, FM is quite good, and Shortwave is equal to the small, pocket Grundig (Grundig is now owned by Eton). I can't think of another pocket radio with so many features

I bought mine at the local discount warehouse for around $[...] with a rebate.  The package included the corded base and 3 handsets.  I've looked into a lot of different phones and read almost every review.  When that wasn't enough, I went to the manufacturers' websites and read the manuals.  I was looking for a 5.8 GHz with the same features as my old Siemens 2420 2.4GHz and this phone is closest I could come to matching it.  The features are current with the exception of two:

1.	Caller ID doesn't use the phonebook for its information.  This is just ridiculous!
2.	The phone doesn't offer Talking Caller ID.  Although this is offered by competitor phones, they use a computer generated program to pronounce the names.  This could be comical with some names.  Uniden offers distinctive ring for phonebook entries, but the rings are annoying and requires you to remember which caller has what ring.

The old Siemens had a feature where the user could program the caller's identifying information into the phonebook and record their name.  When a caller called and was already in the phonebook, the phone would ring once, announce the recorded name, and then continue ringing.  It was a real handy feature for those of us who are too busy to look at the phone to see who is calling.  Obviously, the Talking Caller ID feature I'm referring to would require Uniden to actually refer to the phonebook.  Based on other reviews of their phones, this is just beyond their capabilities.    

Neither of these features mentioned prevented me from buying the phone and the overall quality seems to be great.  The phone does have some handy features the Siemens didn't, i.e.:  2 numbers per 100 phonebook entries, 2 way radio communication between handsets, well lit displays and keypads on the handsets, and backward and forward compatible handsets.  The latter actually swayed me towards Uniden for two reasons:  the handsets are the first to go, and  I can then buy the ELX500 and pair it with my Bluetooth headset.

 Therefore, I rate this phone with 4 stars instead of 5.

  I feel I owe readers this assessment, given how much wasted energy went into trying to find a suitable digital answering machine w/caller ID at a price under $80.  I'm very happy with this machine and feel it has only a few flaws. 

PRO:  Clear sound, nicely-spaced touchtones (even for big fingers), easy set-up, nice look.  Ringer tone is gentle on the ears. Answering machine can be set up to silently record the messages, which is good for privacy in the room. Handset on base is not too heavy, as so many are nowadays.

CON: To me, the biggest flaw is that the remote access code is merely two digits. Not much security there!!! Anyone determined to hear your messages can get access fairly quickly.  Most phones offer just two or three digits, unfortunately, and I've found none that offer four.  Also, only 12 minutes of recording time for messages. One would think they'd expand it to at least 20 minutes. A few blabbers can eat up 12 minutes easily.  A solution is to limit the per-message duration.  Unfortunately, this phone only gives you the option of one minute or four minutes.  What happened to two minutes?  To me, that's a flaw.   
    Another flaw: While you're on the line, you can see the minutes you're using up on the LCD screen (nice!), but you can't see the number of who you are talking with!  That number quickly vanishes when the call connects.  (You can, of course, retrieve it with the Redial button, which shows your last 3 calls -- but only after you hang up.)  
    Final flaw:  You cannot retrieve your messages off the base phone by using the base handset.  So that means that people in the room will hear you retreiving the messages through the base speaker. The only solution is to always retreive messages thorugh the extra cordless handset, which can be a pain if it's in another room.  A Uniden rep tells me that this is standard on all digital answering machines.  Too bad, if true. It seems that issues of privacy and security are not foremost for the makers of these phones.  

  Again, I love this phone.  Other that the cons listed above, I couldn't be happier with everything else about it

I would have rated 4 1/2 stars, just for the minor Cons below, but couldn't, so rated the full 5. Can't attest to the interference with a wireless network, because I'm not there yet but....

Pros:
1. Renaming handsets to location, e.g., Bedroom, Cellar, 1st Floor.
2. Can turn main ringer off on base or handset (in the bedroom, for instance), but still use Transfer Call and Intercom features to that hanset. VERY HANDY FOR LARGE OR MULTIFLOOR HOMES. (Ring is also adjustable.)
3. Phone book. Set it up on the base and send to all the handsets.
4. Adds a "1" to long distance numbers from Caller ID just by pushing the */tone key.
5. Listen to messages from any handset.
6. Audible "Message Indicator." Can turn on or off.
7. Lighted keys (on handsets) and displays.
8. Easy to find the instructions for all the features in the manual. (The PDF manual from Uniden has hyperlinks from the Table of Contents and Index.)
9. Can set handset to "Answer" when picked up from charge base. Handy for the "transfer call" feature so there is only one button to push when you pick up. (Otherwise you have to push green button twice if it's a transferred call, not just an Intercom call--kind of clumsy for the technophobes in the house--see Cons.)
10. Range is excellent (just under .1 mile at my house in the country), great for those with large yards.
11. Two or more handsets can be used at one time. You don't have to "Transfer" the call, you can pick up and join the call, just like in the old days. (Some systems don't allow this!)
12. Corded (for power outages) and cordless combination.

Cons (non deal-breakers, in my opinion):
1. Ringers could be louder on "high" setting. If you listen to your stereo on the loud side the phone is difficult to hear.
2. No different ring tones on the base. 
3. If you have any technophobes in the house it may be difficult to get them to utilize all the features with you, because of the menus and such. (That is probably more of a personal con than that of the phone!)
4. One or two too many buttons to push to delete a Caller ID number. (Do you really need an "Are you sure?" message for such a simple decision?)
5. Can't delete the Caller ID numbers from all the phones at once. (Although before I got this system that was the case anyway.)
6. Not wall mountable. (Not an issue for me, but I wouldn't let it be a deal-breaker. Why does the corded base HAVE to be on the kitchen wall, for instance.)

I have already recommended this system to friends. Wish I had gotten to my mother before she got the VTech IA5874, which doesn't allow multiple handset use and calls have to be transferred from one handset to the next (plus, no corded base)

Easy to order and I received the phone in a reasonable amount of time.  I like the phone, however; the description was deceptive.  I was looking for a phone that had a message waiting indicator for voice mail.  It said that there was a message waiting indicator but after I got the phone I discovered that it is only for the digital answering machine.  That was unclear.  I have had to install a caller id box to discern whether or not there is a voicemail message (or I have to pick up the phone receiver to here the tone).  Redundant service since the uniden has caller id and caller waiting id.  I had a similar uniden phone that I purchased 2 years ago that had both digital answering machine and a voicemail indicator, which is what I was looking for.  Too much of a hassle to exchange it so I will chalk it up to experience

Would give a 4.5 Looks better than other Uniden's I've owned. Base is not flimsy. Good sound quality. Can program all numbers & personalized rings into one phone and transmit to others with one button. 3 cons:
-ring is adjustable only to off, low and high
-no choice of base ringer tones
-need to remove caller ID seperately on each unit (same with other Uniden phones)

Flakey, like nearly all of D-Link's wireless products.

Some days it works, connecting fine to the Dlink WPA-PSK router I have, and sometimes it won't connect at all.

The 100mb/s wired ethernet always works, though, and works very well.

A nice wired camera, that sometimes will do wireless as well

I bought four of these. 1 works as advertised, 1 only works only wired (never sees any wireless networks), 1 works intermittently (doesn't often link up to the wireless network), and the last was DOA (doesn't hook up to either wired or wireless networks).  I think D-link sent them out a bit early; HW revision A1 & firmware revision 001.  As usual, D-link's support is pretty much non-existent and there are no firmware or other updates available.  If you're going to take your chances on one (or four), make sure you buy it/them from someplace that has a decent money-back warranty

I purchased the DCS-G900 in August and it works as advertised.   It can be accessed and administered with just your web browser (type the camera's IP address into the address bar), or you can use the IPView Lite SE that comes with the camera to gain some extra features like Motion Detection, multiple camera control (up to 4) within the same IPView window and the ability to rotate the image 90 degrees (the internal camera settings will allow you to only mirror and\or flip the image, not turn it 90 degrees).

The max resolution is 640x480 (300K pixels), so it's not the same quality as a mega-pixel digital camera, but I have it trained on the front door at my place of business and I can recognize the people coming and going.  

I tested the email feature and it works great.  Enter the same credentials you use to log into your regular ISP mailbox, enter a recipient's address and you're off and running.

I installed the IPView software specifically for the Motion Detection feature.  The camera is still always on and displaying a live picture, but when motion detection is enabled, it also automatically starts/stops recording any activity causing change in the camera's image.  The amount of change in the image required to activate the recording is adjustable using a SENSITIVITY slider.  The downside to that is now I need a computer up and running just to host IPView and provide storage space for the recordings....  They could have built the motion detection functionality into the camera, but then you'd still need storage space for the recordings and we'd probably being paying more for the camera.

The Power and Link LED lights can be set to NORMAL, so folks can see the thing is actively working, or OFF, so it doesn't grab anyone's attention, or DUMMY, which makes them blink randomly so people can't tell if they're being seen or not.  

I too initially had a problem getting the camera to locate my wireless network but it wasn't the camera's fault.  Like any good network administrator, I disabled my wireless router's ability to broadcast my network's SSID (name), which effectively means there was no network name for the camera to find.  If you momentarily enable the SSID broadcast on your wireless router, your camera should be able to find the network and complete the handshake.  Once your camera has made the connection, you can once again disable the SSID broadcast and leave it disabled (until you want to connect another device).

I haven't used the FTP feature, but if it works as well as the email feature, you should be happy with the result.

I can't speak about the quality of customer service, as there was no need for it.

For the price and quality of this camera, you can't go wrong!

I've made the biggest mistake of buying 6 of these cameras only to find out that the images does not get recorded at all. I called the technical support of D-Link and all they did was make me repeat the trouble 4 times and promise me to pass me to level 2 support and then they'd drop the line. If I call back, I had to go through the same routine all over again. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT or you will be as sorry as I am now

First, I also own 2 DCS-900w cameras that although a little twitchy to setup, have been running fine for over a year.  However, the G900 worked fine when connected by Ethernet but does not work wirelessly.  I know the setup is correct as I'm using the same setup as the other cameras - it doesn't see any wireless networks.  And a call to D-Link support simply suggested returning the unit so I suspect they know there is a problem on some units

This SanDisk reader makes it very easy to maintain a digital photo collection.  Before I bought one on an intuitive whim, I had been connecting my digital cameras to my computer.  What a mistake I was making.  The first time I used the reader, the response was instantaneous, and the transfer speed excellent.  I save battery power on the camera and time since transfer with a camera tends to be slower.

Also, because the reader is so easy to use (and because I use Picasa - [...]- very intuitive photo management software), I am finding a lot more joy in phototaking, since the organization and saving process is faster.  I take more digital pictures now than I ever did.

One note: I even tried putting a Sony MemoryStick into the slot, and the reader was able to read the files perfectly even though the form factor of the MemoryStick is smaller; this was a great bonus

This is a wonderful multi brand memory stick reader.
I have been using the older version for years. I use the Sony Memory Stick Pro but it accepts other brands as well. If this is less money that the Sony Brand Reader, there is no reason to buy Sony.
Plug and play, easy and software included

When I purchased the Iway 500 I wrongly thought that it was the same as the I-way 350 only with a larger screen and more features because it was the more expensive item. The screen size was excellent and its overall performance was very good. However it was too heavy and inconvenient to hold and bring back and forth from car to car and home. The fact that it  didn't have a battery also was inconvenient. The screen was bright and clear on both models.  The auditory turn by turn directions with adjustable volume is also very good. Another excellent feature is the automatic recalculating of directions should you choose to vary from the initially calculated route.  In other words it accurately keeps up with you giving new directions from your most current position

This unit is right at the top for GPS , the only thing that I had to do was send it back for the People at Lowrance to update to the 1.7 ver,and everything is excellent now.Taken alot of small trips with it and the unit is better than I thought it would be for detail

It works as advertised.  It takes a little while to fine tune it to get the right mix bettwen interstate and local roads.  It will sometimes tell you to make a left or a right incorrectly.  Another intesting thing to note is that it will sometime miss turns or fail to tell you to be in a particular lane and other times it warns about what lane you should be in. I would recommend this product

Immediately after purchasing, we left on a 6000 mile trip. The large bright screen is excellent, the satellite acqusition was fast and the tracking on the map view exceeded our expectations. Worked in both warm and cold weather and provided good navigation, especially if you had the destination address. 
The major weakness was the directions were hard to follow- we learned more by trial & error. We had to download updated software for ours, which was a bit time consuming.

The Lowrance 500C works great. It is especially helpful when making several stops in unfamiliar places. I was surprised to find it was able to navigate to my week-end home which is on a dirt road in the mountains. The mount is quite secure. My Nissan Pathfinder provides a space for the unit to rest. The screen is large and bright enough to see in all lights. Sound from the power cord is loud and clear without attaching to your speakers. The unit is heavy but detaches easily when it is removed. I purchased the unit from Amazon who delivered it promptly as promised.
Check to see if Lowrance is still offering a $[...] rebate. If so this should be a good purchase.

I have this unit for 1 year now. Greatest problems. (BTW, I have latest software 1.7.0) 
1. Unit heats up in just 30 minutes. Just in 30 minutes of navigation, the unit showed this message "Please cool the unit or the unit will shutdown". Imagine you are in New York city . and the unit shows this message. I had such multiple instances. I had magallen before which had 20gb harddisk, which is lighter and does not have a heat sink nor has heat problems. 
2. Unit recognizes that you are OffRoute but takes long time to regenerate the way. 
3. The directions are always "beating around the bush" rather than shortest distance. 
4. On entering addresses, it says the road not in database, but when you are driving on the same road, the unit shows the name of the same road on the top of scree

Don't buy this unit. The database is terrible, and Lowrance wants $75 for an update. This unit has sent me on wild goose chases looking for stores that moved from the database's given address years ago. It has no listing for businesses that have existed for years, and more often than not tells you to turn after you already passed the street it wanted you to turn on. Extremely disappointing, and definitely not worth the money

I purchased the Lowrance iWay500C based upon the rating on Amazon and also it met all my needs and wants. My family and I travel alot and this seemed like a good way to get where we are going in unfamiliar territory. I have tested it around Virginia Beach, VA for about the past week.  Other websites I used to make my decision:
[..]

Pros:
   1. Nice large display! I can glance at the display while I am driving easily. Very bright display so easy to read during the day, and the light can be dimmed easily for night use.
   2. Speaker is nice and clear.
   3. The RAM windshield mount works well; the unit shakes if unsupported, but I put it on the dash and that seemed to work really well. Easy to take on and off the mount.
   4. Easy to navigate between menus.
   5. Detailed maps; I purposely went off the route a couple of times, and after trying to get me to turn around it recalculated the route.

Cons:
   1. It is heavy; but that is not an issue if placed on the dashboard.
   2. It overheated and kept recycling modes - very annoying.  I left the unit inside the car while I did some errands and when I came back out (it was a warm, but not an overly hot day) the unit kept cycling between display modes and it was annoying to say the least. The unit stopped doing this after about 5 minutes in the A/C and I unplugged/re-pligged the unit.
   3. I found it was about 50 - 100ft off at most intersections. Accurate enough for me.
   4. I did find a couple of roads that were not in the maps. I don't know how often they update the roads.

The family and I are heading to PA this weekend - this will be the test to see if I keep it or return it.  I hope this review helps others

I just returned from a 4,000-mile road trip and had the opportunity to give the Lowrance iway 500 C a good work out.  I was pleasantly surprised to find the 500 C functioned flawlessly.  Like all GPS units, it occasionally did not select the route that I wanted, however after driving a short distance it reprogrammed to the correct route.  Finding POI's is somewhat awkward, but this may be due to operator error.  I especially liked the large screen and the interface.  Being able to switch between two screens with different scales was a nice feature.  The night mode in 3d is remarkable.  Great GPS for the money and highly recommend it

Printer has had very light use and suddenly developed mostly magenta & cyan toner leaks. The excess toner is streaked and transfered to every page resulting in full length page striping. The print outs are absolutely useless for presentation and barely useable for drafts. HP denies there is a problem however I see that I am not the only one with this issue. Won't buy HP again. This is clearly a defective product design. There is no resolve. Your printer is now an expensive and rather large doorstop.

Now we have this printer for nearly 2 years in office use, and before purchase we find that this printer has a good price per printout. But noone expected that some of the cartridges make stripy printout (with black, cyan and margenta)when the cartridge is only 50% used.... so the price per page doubles due to some misconstructed cartridges. 
The support is also annoying - noone feels resonsible for this problem and the printout price rises by 100%

We won't buy another HP color printe

This printer started off wonderfully.  Then, over the past year, the toner leaks and noise from the printer is unbearable.  My office has tried to contact HP but to no avail.  The HP service department doesn't speak english.  In fact, their gibberish sounds like the adult speech from a Charlie Brown cartoon.  What's worse, problems with the printer, or the non-caring attitude of HP?  At this point, after 2 years of operation, we've decided to launch the printer from our office roof top. We'll video the coverage and send to David Letterman.  HP has lost a very long-standing customer.

i have been using an HP 4600 for about 2 years now. There is one more printer of the same model in my building. BOTH printers have developed this problem of printing a nice, fat magenta line across the backs of pages. This problem was not so bad on my printer until just recently, but now over 50% of what I print goes straight to the recycling bin becuase the printer ruins the pages with that line!! VERY ANNOYING!!! It works great other than that. It seems like a problem that would be easy to resolve but its NOT. NO ONE can fix it! We have called several repair people who have come to look at it and they are all stumped. The only advice HP will give is to simply clean it with a damp cloth. This resolves the problem long enough to end your help session with HP and then the line is back again! The other 4600 in the building was just replaced becuase of the red line problem.  I am on the verge of losing my mind and/or replacing mine!
They don't even make this printer anymore. I wonder why? HA HA!!
I have been lucky enough to not have the "dirty pages" issue, but this red line is just as bad. It comes off with an eraser, but its still noticeable enough that you can't use the pages for distributing to the public- too crappy looking!
THIS PRINTER IS A WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY

I bought this radio thinking, "Hey, I live in the Bay Area. I shouldn't experience the reception problems that users in rural areas have reported." Unfortunately, I was wrong. I was just looking for a simple radio to use while running but this isn't it. I typically listen to NPR so it's not like my fidelity standards are high, but the static and the inability to get a clear signal was just too much. I supposed I got what I paid for -- and now I'm going to go pay more for something I'm acually willing to listen to

Good sound and works decent enough.  Price is definitely it's best feature.  The neck strap will keep the earphones from breaking prematurely.  Plenty of preset channels so u don't have to worry about using the tuner to get to a channel manually.  A downside is u can't control the reception, so whatever u hear on the station, that's what u get.  It's best reception is with the big radio stations.  Battery life seems to be good.  I'd recommend this product since even the more expensive ones seem to breakdown just as easily as the cheaper ones.

I searched all over to find a cool little am radio. I take it to take to the Yankee games so I can listen to the commentator.  This radio has great reception and is very easy to program presets.  I'm impressed that it was so inexpensive.

I just receive this radio today. Yet it is totally useless. I cant hear anything from this poor radio. It just keeps scaning and repeats over and over. It does not receive any station at all. It is even worse than my $3 mini radio bought in walgreen. What s bad radio. Avoid this item.

This one is a winner in my book. I ride my bycicle at least 10 miles every other day and sometimes more. Having used other radios during my ride was usually more trouble then they were worth, I was always losing a station or fiddling with the volume control due to a fading channel. The Coby CX-9 Locks on to a station and holds it without fade. One push of a preselect button and I have another favorite station to listen to. Very portable with belt clip. Great job Coby

Oh, man.  I bought mine at a massive discount and it was still too much.  Build quality is poor, most notably the flimsy door on the battery case, and reception in both bands is abominable.  As an alternative, consider buying one of the excellent and slightly cheaper manual-tuning pocket radios from Sony or Panasonic.  If you're willing to pay about $10 more, you can get a vastly better Sony digital-tuning radio with additional TV and weather bands (available from Target, no less.)  Just thought I'd save you the trouble of buying this thing

I got this at a 1 day sale with rebates and customer coupons for a song.  
I basically unpacked the box, plugged it into my existing wired network, plugged in the slim power adapter into the 110 volt wall outlet, and in about 1 minute, my existing 2 wireless PCs reconfigured their proxy settings (running Win2000ProSp3 and WinXPProSP2) and both were able to use Internet Explorer and Outlook email with very fast downloads. 
Netgear supplies a slim zippered padded case that fits the router, power adapter, and all the supplied cables. Throw it into your PC case or your shoulder bag and be ready to go online wirelessly wherever a wired Ethernet port is found while traveling.

I'll try to add some additional perspectives to the other reviews.  

1) My configuration includes a Netgear PC CARD (108G), Dell C640 laptop.  I was able to configure this unit with WPA on the first try and had no difficulty with 1 laptop connected.  I have not tried 2 or more pc's yet.

2) Previously I carried around a Linksys BEFW11S4 V4 router for hotel use, as these are going for around $9 now it doesn't matter if the maid steals it.  But this unit is MUCH smaller and lighter.

3) I wish the power supply had been built into the unit with an integrated, folding power plug.  Adding an external power supply and cable adds a lot of bulk, but less than the BEFW.

4) The unit was flawless in 4 days of use.  Never dropped a connection at all.  This with WPA configured and SSID not being broadcast.  I use the ATHEROS client software, although the NETGEAR client would probably work just as well.

5) Paid only 17 bucks for this with rebates, so it's a little more expensive than an 802.11B router.

6) comes with a nice carrying case that keeps the power supply and router together.

7) Mine is new and came with the latest firmware loaded.  If you are downloading the firmware, be sure to follow Netgear's directions.  With Netgear routers, I have found that you need to do a factory reset after flashing and the re-key all of the device settings.  Otherwise things will NOT work right.

8) I see that Linksys is coming out with one that has some nice features like, ability to expand a wireless network, say you are in a coffee house with wireless access, you supposedly can use this router to expand the wireless access. It also has integrated power supply... sweet..

After only owning this wireless router for about 2 months, I am now shopping around for a replacement travel wireless access point.  This device's firmware is EXTRMELY buggy... here are a few of the issues that I have noticed while using this paper weight:

1) If you use WPA-PSK with this device, expect your connection to drop every 60 minutes -- and sometimes at random.  The only way to recover from this is to either wait it out (about 5 minutes) or reboot the WGR-101 (about 3 minutes).

2) This device is EXTRMELY slow -- and what I mean by this is not network speed, but the WGR-101s processing speed.  As I mentioned above, it takes the device about 3-4 minutes to fully boot this device.

3) I tested WEP briefly on this device and noticed some issues with this as well.  The connection would drop as it did with WPA-PSK, only it seemed to be at random.

If you are looking for a reliable travel wireless access-point, this device is NOT for you.

I recently purchased a laptop with intel centrino technology at CompUSA and got this travel router as a freebee after rebates.  I pluged the ethernet cable from my cable modem into the travel router to give it a try and it worked great!- Ahh, the the trill of wireless!! This won't take the place of a real router for home use, but it's a nice little travel router.

Excellent product guys! I was little sceptical before buying this product as the reviews were not very encouraging. But, I have not experienced any kind of problem with this slim and nice looking router. There was a little hitch while installing it, but, the customer support helped me figure that out quickly. Excellent customer support from Netgear. And the good part is that it works with my cable internet connection at home also.

This is one of those things that I bought, really hoping and wanting to be able to say good things about.  I really wanted this to be a good product; but it's just not.

First off, the firmware releases have been quite buggy and while they have added WPA support, I find that it does not work well.  I think that if you wanted to use this device without encryption and without changing the DHCP range and not in any sort of 'must-have' environment, maybe it would work.  For me, all of those things have caused me more headaches than I care to remember.

I have had a lot of problems with...
-Using WPA with multiple devices connected at once, the signal drops every 60 minutes, like clockwork.  To get the signal back, you have to repower the router and restart your wireless card.  Very frustating.  When I tried to get Netgear's help, they told me to reload the firmware - I did this but to no avail.

-The DNS passthrough resolution stinks.  (Sorry if I 'tech out' on you here, but this is an issue some may find valuable to know about.)  In many situations, I can not get DNS resolution through the 'gateway', which is of course the WRG101.  To resolve I have to go into the router's browser interface, pull of the DNS server IPs that the hotel or ISP issued to the WAN port and manually configure my IP settings in my WinXP Pro machine to use those DNS servers.  This works, but what a pain.

At the end of the day, I can't get Netgear to give me anything resembling decent support on this thing and I would say it only works for me 20% of the time without monkeying around with it.  I keep trying (and hoping for better firmware)(as of v.1009 it still stinks) but I'm sure that someday this thing will find it's way into a hotel room garbage can - or better yet, out the window.  

Look elsewhere if you want encryption and stability - this is a bummer product.

I bought this somewhere else, but wanted to get another review out here for reference in case someone else was considering this product.

This took a little bit longer to get set up than I expected and longer than a wired plus wireless DSL router I have.  I had two main problems. First, the darn thing is slow serving up its internal pages in configuration mode. (By the way, you can directly connect via a cable to configure it.) Second, getting the WEP and DHCP settings to stick took a while. That said, I had the same trouble with the previously mentioned DSL router, too. After getting over these two hurdles it works like a champ and I've not had any trouble connecting across the room, etc.

Beyond the product itself, I haven't quite figured out how to stow everything in the included case.  The bits don't quite fit in the supplied slots.  This is especially true for the power supply.

All in all, this fits the bill for what I wanted it for - a way to use the 802.11 connection from the laptop when in the hotel traveling

After buying a panasonic dvd video recorder, I bought twenty of these discs to feed it.  After seeing the light, I did some research and have discovered for myself a great storage medium.  I'd always discounted DVD-RAM as a panasonic proprietary product, but this is designed to save data like a hard disk, in concentric circles.  So your computer sees it just like a hard disk.  And, it is much more stable than -+r dvds.  Too much technical data to spew here, but do some web searches on the design of dvd ram, you'll be impressed.  I liked it so much, I bought three new drives that read/write dvd ram for my home computers.  Happy camper

This is the best price I've found on these great Panasonic DVD's.  My DVR works best with RAM discs - they're re-writable and last "forever" - I've read that they can be used 100,000 times - since 100,000/365 = 273.9 I'm guessing it'll be two centuries before I find out if they wear out.  These are Panasonic, and at the time I'm writing, including postage charged, come to a price almost as low as the cheap Wal-mart one-use throwaways.  What more do you want

With this and the proper device (recorder, drive, etc)you can record in high quality (Xp = 1 hour), Standard Quality (Sp = 2 hours), Medium (Lp = 4 hours) and low quality (EP = 6 hours).
Not only that, you also can cut, edit, erase easily and even view what you're recording at the same time.

If you have the correct device to use these, buy them, you will not regret it

Bought this player on June 23, 2006. For five months, it worked fine. It's small and easy to use. Very nice player. But, then, without any reason, it stopped working. (BTW, it works fine as usb drive.) Now, I'm starting the warranty process. So far, the SanDisk people have been helpful. Hopefully, this will continue. Keep copies of your order. You might need it

I bought two MP3 players one as gift and one for personal use.  The batteries that came with unit did not last but 3 days but replacement lasted very well.  I had to replace the ear buds due to discomfort with long use.  My friend loves her player except has problem with radio reception.  I have no problem with mine.  She loaded over 400 songs on her player.  I would recommend this player to anyone.  I would buy it again

Still getting used to the button format, but sound is very good. Holds true to capacity and is VERY small, but has search features lacking on Apple Shuffle. Price was way better than apple products, and while downloading music is a bit cumbersome (compared to iTunes) it is very easy to tote. 

Go for it

This is my THIRD DT200V - need I say more? 
But you can ask me "why three??". Because the first two died the same death after about 5 or 6 yrs of use: the blue "on/off" switch died (I think) and could not turn the thing on :-(
But being the best little radio around (I love to listen to "GMA" in the morning while I run around getting ready for work) I keep replacing them with the same, hoping that Sangean will improve/fix that pesky "on/off" switch sometime soon

Ieir units will continue to be available for me. (2) to address some comm am posting this on both the DT-200V and 210V sites, as it relates to both. I am writing for several reasons. (1) Sangean makes the best "walkman" ever made by any company ever, and I want to help make sure thents made by other reviewers. (3) to comment on 200 vs. 210 features. (4) Please note that I commute primarily by bicycle, sometimes motorcycle, so my needs are not those of most. And even though I protect itas much as possible, in a pouch on a fanny-pack belt (except when I'm at work or in the steam room), it nevertheless is probably exposed to environmental extremes more than most (like steam heat and salt air). 
(1) I first bought the 200V years ago (8 or 10, I think), when it was the first to have AM/FM/TV audio, and I found it to be one of those rare examples where so much attention is paid to detail, but in design and manufacturing, that the product actually does MORE than you expected (more below) (2) Others have discussed AM reception, but my bigger concern is FM reception.  I found that I can be in my gym n Santa Monica, surrounded by all the electronics, dial in a weak FM NPR station in Pasadena, and bring it in loud and clear in stereo, no problem; with the other Brands, either I'd have to switch to Mono, or the station wouldn't come in at all; ditto for other areas where good reception is difficult.  I've been spoiled. (3) One reviewer said Sangean was the only one who made this type. Actually, in the first couple of years I tried other brands,including Sony, Aiwa, Radio Shack (et al.), and not one came even close to Sangean in quality (reception, sound qualilty, ease of use), notwithstanding their names (4) Another reviewer complained that his "died" after "only" 2 1/2 years.  Mine also had to be replaced every 2 1/2 to 3 years.  Given the abuse I put it through, I think that's great.  Moreover, Sangean has this incredible "out of warranty" replacement program.  Basically, every few years,I have replaced the one I bought retail with a brand new one, for a fraction of the price.  (5) I discovered, through playing around with it, pluses that Sangean never even mentioned.  One example (there are several):  All other units, when setting the pre-sets, no matter how many you have already set, when you do the next one, the counter starts at 1, so you have to hit the button twice, then three times, then four, and so on, and repeat to the last preset, and then again for each band.  Sangean is smart enough to know you already set #5 (for example) and doesn't make you start over.  One more example(and them I'll let you discover for yourself).  Re the 4 front buttons on the 200V that I use most, each is contoured, with a raised edge on a different side, making it extraordinarily easy to feel which button I'm touching, with no need to take the unit out and look at it. Try that with any other brand.  (6) Finally, as to the 200V vs. the 210v, I finally lost my 200V while bike riding (my pouch wasn't securely closed), went to the website, found out about the 210V, which seemed like an upgrade and ordered it, only to exchange it.  Overall it is improved, but not for me.  While the 210V has 30 presets, vs. 19 for the 200V, the 30 are divided up, 10 per band, and to change bands you have to hit a separate button.  On the 200, I have the 19 set up with the first 7 on TV, then most on FM, then a few on AM, so if I need to change from 107.5 FM to TV Channel 4 because it's time for Law and Order, I can easily do so, without lookingwhile riding,, just by reaching down, Unlocking, &hitting Memory a few times, cycling from one station to the one I want, regardless of band all in literally 1-2 seconds.  The only negative for me is the 1-hr. automatic shutoff on the 200V; on the 210, you can disable it.  I like that, but nothing's perfect.  I do not own stock in Sangean, but I cannot stop singing their praises. I personally prefer the 200 over the 210, but either one is superior to any supposedly-comparable "walkman" made by anyone else.  Buy one (or two), and then tell your friends.

I got one of these three years ago, and I really loved it. I took it everywhere I went. One day this past summer, my car (with me in it) became totally submerged in rapidly rising flood waters. The car was totalled, and so was my little radio. 

Recently, I joined a gym, and I quickly realized that I needed to get another DT220V because all of the radios I tried to use there were either too bulky or had horrible reception. So I ordered another DT220V, took it to the gym, and now everything is right again. 

It's small, but not too small. It sounds great with headphones, and surprising listenable with just its own little speaker. Best of all, its reception beats anything I've found that is small enough to wear on your belt or in your shirt pocket. Even inside the metal gym, it lets me listen to outside AM and FM stations with no problem.

I'm glad to have my DT220V back. This time, I'm keeping it away from rising waters

This is an astonishingly bad product. I expected much more from Plantronics. Where do I begin? The ear piece constantly buzzes, which is very annoying. Setting up the product is difficult. The sound quality for the person you're calling is very poor. The buttons and switches for adjusting sound quality and voice amplification are confusing and difficult to physically manipulate. Do not buy.

Unbelievable how well this thing works. If you get everything dialed in correctly (your voice volume, etc), this thing is unbelievable. The range on it is just phenomenal. I've walked upwards of 50 yards away from my desk to our kitchen, with maybe no less than 6 or 7 office rooms between the kitchen and my desk, and I had absolutely no static. I'm very impressed with this product, a definite must if you are on the phone a lot

My old 5-year-old wireless headset (which I loved) from another vendor just died, and I bought the CS50/HL10 bundle based on the reviews.  It doesn't disappoint.  

I work a computer job, typing and talking every day.  And sometimes I like to get a cup of coffe in the middle of a conference call, so having a wireless unit is very nice.

The CS50 headset is very lightweight, and comfortable to wear over the head.  I don't like over-the-ear phones so didn't even try that option.  The headset is completely self-contained; that means no wire to a belt unit that snags on doorknobs!

The CS50 has good range, the signal goes through walls, and I notice little to no interference with other wireless phones or electronics in the building.

There are separate volume controls for the earpiece and the microphone; both take some tweaking the first time you use it.  The earpiece volume is on the headset, so it's easy to adjust mid-conversation.  The earpiece also has a mute button that turns off your microphone to handle interruptions.

The HL10 handset lifter is awesome.  If you're away from your desk and the phone rings, you hear a beep in your ear and push a button on the headset.  The remote lifter picks up the phone's handset and you're talking.  The HL10 does require that you have a business-style phone with the dial pad on the base -- not on the handset!  I have an AT&T 2-line phone that will answer whichever line is ringing when the handset is lifted -- and that's the reason they have made this unit the way it is, so it works in any business phone environment.  (The CS50 base unit plugs in between the phone's base and handset, and does not have its own number pad.)  If you don't have the HL10, you take the phone off the hook manually for each call with the CS50.  

For comparison, my previous wireless unit had a weak handset lifter that almost died before the wireless unit did.  This HL10 is snappy when lifting the handset, and I can tell it's going to be much more durable mechanically.  The HL10 also has a much smaller footprint, taking up no desk space.

My only complaint is that the power on LED is solid red, and the charging light is flashing yellow.  Because of the "stop light" association, both colors trigger a "slow down, something must be wrong" reaction at first, but I'm getting used to it.  In my opinion, the power light should be solid amber or green and charging light flashing green or solid amber.  That's a minor aesthetic complaint though.  

The product works exactly as expected, and is much smaller and lighter than I expected.  When I bought this bundle, considering the free shipping, Amazon was only $10 more than the cheapest price I found online, which was on eBay.  So for peace of mind I chose Amazon.com over saving $10.  It arrived quickly in good packaging, and I've been using it every day since.

After almost a year of constant use, I find this to be an overall fantastic tool.  I had an initial problem with the handset lifter, but a call to Plantronics customer service resulted in a replacement being sent out within a few days.

I find the headset very comfortable and adaptable.  As per the previous reviewer, I had comfort problems when using the over the ear hanging adapter with the headset.  I had to switch to the padded adapter.  Now I can wear it all day (and often do) with no problem.

Generally speaking, I find the quality of the signal to be outstanding.  Occasionaly I get some interference or a slight amount of static, but not very often, and it usually doesn't last long.  I am able to walk all around the first and second floors of our building, even outside, with little if any signal degredation.

I would highly recommend this product to anyone who talks on the phone most of the day

I received this Logitech keyboard and mouse as a gift. My last keyboard and mouse were ALSO Logitech wireless. I didnt have to install  anything....just plugged in the cables, pushed the connect button and that was it. I love the touch of the new keyboard and the one button access feature for e-mail, intenet and speakers. I dont understand all the trouble people have had with the mouse batteries. I have had not changed the batteries yet and I have had it for a month. My old Logitech mouse DID have short battery life but with the new one, so far, so good. And I use the computer for several hours every day. I have NO complaints. I definitely recommend it

I was pretty much looking for any inexpensive wireless mouse and keyboard. I saw this to be one of the most inexpensive (I won't say cheap) ones avaliable.

As far as communciation, so far it has been excellent. The mouse took a restart to connect but everything connected and went smoothly.

The keyboard is pretty much your standard keyboard but with additional features. The media feature does not seem to work, my guess is that it works for MusicMatch since it is on the CD. The play/pause button will pause and play your music, this worked in all of my music programs (Windows Media and RealPlayer). The mute and voulme controls worked perfectly. There is a favorites button to open your browser's favorites, the e-mail button open Outlook Express, and the www button goes to your home page.

The mouse is your basic mouse with a scroll. So far it has been very accurate with the reciever, though don't be too suprised if your photo editing gets rough a few times. It is optical and it does not need a trackball and uses a laser.

One of the negatives is the battery life. It is around the area were AA batteries last, which is 15-20 hours. This is ok for some users, but for people using the computer daily for a few hours, that would mean you would have to replace the mouse around 2 times a week, which could get costy. The keyboard doesn't run the entire time you use the computer so it shouldn't be too bad.

It is compatible with Windows 95 and above as well as the latest Mac operating systems. The keyboard can be run on USB or the PS/2 Port but the mouse must use the PS/2. The USB is the slim long port and the PS/2 port (usually colored) is the circle port.

As far as the CD, it contains software but chances are your computer has them already from the Control Panel. There is some adware along with the CD as well. I wold just leave the install CD alone and just plug-and-play.

Overall, this set does have a few quirks, but it is definitely worth the low-cost. 4 stars

from Amazon. The first one was missing a plug-in for the keyboard. Although the one I have now works just fine, the whole process of ordering, returning and ordering again was not worth the wait. I would have been better off buying one from a local electronics store.

I love this set, though. It works just as well as the higher-priced cordless desktop sets out there.

I bought this product for use in my office.  In less than two months I have changed the batteries in the keyboard 5 times and once in the mouse.  I also had problems with the keyboard in regards to connecting to the receiver.  The keyboard would often lose the connection and needed to be set-up again.  Good price but buyer beware...You get what you pay for...I am now going to return this product and try out the Microsfot Elite Office wireless duo.

I bought the Logitech Cordless Desktop at Target set because I felt it would be nice to have a Keyboard and Mouse that do not tug if I get tangled wires.  It is nice, after all.  However, I found that this set is definately not the way to go if you play games or have any program where you may need to hold the moues button.

After returning two of these sets already, the mouse seems fine after 5 days, but it soon starts to squeek louder and louder after you hold down the buttons.  (Such as controlling your character on World of Warcraft, as in my case.)  The noise is tolerable at first, but you find yourself soon surfing the internet and having this horrible mouse screach at you every time you click everywhere.  While I am typing this review on this terrible product, I am taking this back tommorow and getting the Microsoft cordless keyboard and mouse set...  $20 more, but you get what you pay for.

I recommend a different product, or better yet, a completely different brand altogether.  Logitech has let me down horribly

I purchased these headphones to replace the awful walkman style ones we were forced to use for our talk radio show, and since using them, our sound quality and consitency have improved dramatically.  Now we hear the mixer output at the same volume with stunning clarity.  They sheild just enough outside sound so that ambient noise doesn't get through, and you can still be aware of your surroundings.  I would recommend this product for anyone on a tight budget planning to do sound editing or play online games

These are selling REAL cheaply on Amazon. For under five bucks, you can't even get a meal, but you can get these headphones. So ends the positive things I can say about these headphones.

Now for the negatives: Harsh treble, muddy bass, overemphasized midrange, not very comfortable if worn over long periods, kind of ugly and clunky. I can't think of a pair of headphones for less money that's better, if you consider that a recommendation, but for about twice the price (still pocket change) you can get a decent cheap set of Koss KCS75 earphones which are better in every conceivable way to these. I mean, even the junk earbuds that came in the box with your mp3 player are likely better than these. 

Uh, well, every way unless you WANT ugly and clunky over the ear phones. If you want good over the ear phones, Koss offers those, too, at reasonable prices.

If you think "they can't be THAT bad, and at the price I'll try them" then I'll remind you that a fool and his money are soon parted, and leave it at that...

How many pictures will it store?  It is the most commonly asked question from digital camera enthusiast but usually the question that is the most difficult to get a straight answer about.  Well, considering I worked in the memory industry for over 7 years I can help clarify this perplexing question and do so unbiased as I have since changed industries.  

The Viking 128MB Secure Digital Card, like most 128MB cards, will store on average 142 pictures when used with a 2 megapixel camera, 106 images when used with a 3 megapixel camera,  64 pictures when used with a 4 megapixel camera, 51 images when used with a 5 megapixel camera, and 40 pictures when used with a 6 megapixel camera.  These numbers are based off the assumption that you are going to shoot your images at the highest quality JPEG setting available for the camera and understand that they are estimates and may be off by as much as 10 percent due to numerous factors including the complexity of the scene being shot and the compression algorithm used by your specific camera.

I truly hope this review was helpful to you in determining whether this card is the right capacity for your specific needs

I bought this DLO Transpod (black) after waiting some time to make sure there was a product on the market I could live with and not be disappointed by. I got it just before a road trip from Nashville to Gulf Shores, AL and it worked wonderfully. I could not have been more impressed, CD-quality sound with no static or interruptions. Now driving to work every day in Nashville I sometimes have to switch stations to ensure there is no static or interference, and songs with a lot of bass (hip-hop mostly) do cause a little static from time to time, but overall no regrets. I'd say if you lived in Atlanta or a city over a couple million people with lots of radio stations, you might want to spend more and invest in a direct hard-wired solution (I have a Honda Accord and considered it but would lose the satellite radio option should I ever decide to use it). For me this was an excellent choice

Do not believe what anybody tells you about FM Transmitters (except me of course). This product works like a charm. You might hear people say that FM Transmitters don't work or that the sound quality is horrible, don't listen. It works great on the first channel (at least in central Jersey). The sound quality is fine and it is incredibly easy to use. It really fits in any car too. In my car I have a unique situation. The ciggaret lighter is jammed in a small corner right next to the gearshift. I thought there was no chance on earth that it would fit. I couln't have been more wrong. The extendable arm really dose the trick. It fits fine and doesn't even go near the gearshift. So don't worry about this product not fitting in your car, which is another thing people might tell you. This really is the perfect solution for listening to your iPod in the car. Put all of your worries aside and get it.

I have a mini - bought it a week before the nanos came out - thats what I get for not doing more research.  
This transmitter has been great I have never experienced a lick of static.  From other reviews I am reading, I guess the kind of car you have it in makes a difference - mine is mostly used in an 06 Mustang. My only problem is that it does not fit the mini very well and the mini has a tendancy to lean back and rattle on the transmitter.  I just reach up and push  the ipod back down on the connection, but it can be a little annoying.  I tried a Griffin itrip because I did not want the transmitter mounted on my dash, I wanted it connected to the power inside my armrest - but the static was aweful - this is a much better product IMO.

I was skeptical about this device, because I had been using an iTrip with my 4GB iPod, which could not hold a signal for more than a few minutes, even when stationary.

When I got my 30GB video iPod, I gambled with purchasing this device.

As it turned out, I am utterly delighted with it. The signal is clear and constant, even when driving long distances through hilly terrain.   Very highly recommended.

We have had a wonderful experience with the Transpot In-Car Cradle. Compared to the Griffin iTrip and casette audio adaptor, this device is a jem! We have used it for a few months on several long drives and local city commute, and find that it is worth every penny. It's key for long trips to have your iPod being charged as you drive. Also, the sound quality is great. Far superior to the iTrip. It's a breeze to change the station even while driving through various cities. The arm extends to a convenient height while keeping the iPod safe. We enjoy it so much we are purchasing it as gifts for friends

I've been using this transmitter for a month now, it sound very good, although i think none transmitter sound better than using a line-in.

Just something you need to know if your gonna use it with other than ipod, like me (i have a SanDisk Sansa e270). You can use the DLO with a male-male headphone jack, that would let you use any audio device, like my sansa, but that audio device needs to deliver a good volume so you don't get some static o distortion in some tracks. That's happening to me right now.

The instruction in the DLO let you know this issue, so i still gave this product 4 stars, and because i know the Sansa does'nt have that great volume.

If this happens to you, you can correct this issue buying a volume booster, there are some great deals online starting at 20 bucks, i'm recieving mine this week. I'll post another review and update if this have improve the sound.

In Conclusion, after checking a lot of reviews online and some research too, i consider this transmitter the best out there, if you defenitly need a transmitter this is the one right now, even if you don't own a ipod

Well, this is an excellent product.  Out of all of the car-mounting, charging, docking, transmitters, this one offeres the highest quality and best performance available.  It however, is not perfect.  The only issue with it is that the volume is preset inthe machine itself, so it will only go as loud as your car stereo will allow, not as loud as the ipod AND the stereo.  That's still respectively loud without distortion.  So all in all, it's a quality product, a little on the pricy side, but as far as this arena goes, ya get what you pay for

I first tried the iTrip for my Ipod and wasn't impressed.  There was too much static and the least little touch caused noise.  I've been much happier with the Transpod.  I don't know if it's because it is plugged into something metal in the dash or what but the reception is much better, and it makes a nice dash mount holder

   This device has worked flawlessly for over 3 months.  Granted, I am a Network Engineer and already know a lot about how to configure networks so installation for me was a snap.  I never read any of the documentation so I cannot say how clear the directions are or how easy this device is to install by reading the directions.  For me, it was basically plug and play after a few minor adjustments to set up the security that my network uses.  Since then, it was worked perfectly for over 3 months without EVER losing connectivity.  I also kind of cheat and share this device between my tivo and my xbox360 through a small hub since it is cheaper than buying two adapters and I have never had any issues.  From the other reviews, it sounds like people had difficulties configuring the device.  My suggestion would be to use this device if you are comfortable configuring networking components.  If you have never set up a network, you may want to try a different adapter or be ready to seek professional help installing if you run into problems.

I keep telling myself 'no more Linksys' and this product might have finally convinced me to live up to my word.  What a piece of cr*p.  Worked for 3 days (just fine) when I first connected it and then just stopped.  Wireless light (which is supposed to indicate connectivity) just blinked slowly and steadily - no transmission.

Spent 90 minutes with a tech support rep in a chat session - who was very nice and tried but refused to consider an exchange until we finished 'diagnosing' the problem.  Problem was, after an hour and a half of my evening - with absolutely zero progress - the rep simply vanished.  The chat didn't end - he just stopped replying.

Sorry Linksys - I'm done

I got this adapter to allow a recorder (KISS DP 558)to connect wirelessly to my WIFI network and hence avoid running cable all around the house.

This product is very basic and not very sophisticated. However the set up was frustrating:
1- the PC/laptop used for the initial setup has to have a fixed IP in the same rage as the WGA54
2- If using mac filtering, make sure the mac address of the adaptor and the device to be networked are both entered in the mac list.
3- Even though the adaptor has found the router and got connected, the status LEDs will only light when data is transfered. Thi scan be misleading especially at the begining when looking for signs of life.

When all the above was done, the adapter functionned perfectly and video and audio streaming as well as file transfering was a joy.

My daughter presented me with this Koss DVD Player and seeing the price I became negative. Was I surprised. She hooked it up in a few minutes, the instructions were simple to follow and she loaded the new DVD into the player, it read the DVD and I was so delighted with the picture &amp; sound featured on my 17&quot; TV. I'm a senior citizen and not acquainted with technology of today and it was ideal for me. I also played a CD on the player and the sound was incredible. This was the best gift I have received other than jewelry when hubby was alive. Buy it, you will not be sorry

The Koss KD250 works very well. Although it can't beat a $$$ panasonic dvd player in sound and video quality, it sure wins on price. Not only did it do everything as advertised, it also has some hidden features not advertised. Inside my box were instructions on how to unlock the region code restrictions and also how to enable VCD player mode. If your box did not include these instructions, just do a quick search on the web for DVD Hacks and you will have instructions soon enough

I bought this DVD player as a cheap second system.  The first DVD I tried played perfectly, but the second kept skipping sections with the message that it was skipping over bad spots.  Since the DVD was new, had no scratches and played perfectly on other players I assumed the player was defective and traded it for an identical player.  The new player worked with that DVD, but with the very next DVD the problems were back. I'm returning the second Koss player today and looking for another brand

I was quite excited seeing the Koss so cheap in Canada, and better yet my friend recommended it. He glowed about how well it worked. Being a techno geek I thought no problem. I unpack, hook-up, put batteries in the remote, and turn it on, but nothing. Notta anything. Everything was hooked up correctly, but the remote didn't work (even tried new batteries), nor did any button on the machine (excluding the power button). I was so ticked that my new toy didn't work. I managed to put in a cd (A Christmas Story)and got it to play by hitting the power button a few times but i couldn't stop or eject or do anything else. Only the power button opened and closed the cd tray. I shall return it tomorrow ...to replace this faulty dvd player and hopefully they have built a better one for me by then, as I have heard great things about the Koss system

This is the first MP3 player, or maybe that should be WMA player I have even had. This type of technology is always involves some kind of compromise to make it possible to manufacture something useful that people can afford to buy, so I tend not to jump in and buy new technologies, but this machine, which could hold the contents of 600 CDs looked like something I could use.

Prior to buying this unit, I had, for several months been downloading radio broadcasts, converting them to MP3, burning them to CD and taking them with me on the road to play in my car and other places. I have been using desktop computers since the days of DOS. I mention these points up front, because this device is definitely not something I would recommend to someone who is not fairly computer and recording competent.

My first hour or two trying to get this thing working were still very frustrating, even though I had taken the time to study both the manuals ahead of time.

This unit is supposed to 1) Organize, record and play music, 2) Store and display photographs, 3) Act as a portable drive. Let's look at each in turn.

1) If most of your music is already on CD, and you want to rip your CDs to the machine, and you have lots of them, then this IS what you want. It is really easy to rip the CDs to the unit, and off you go.

However if you want to do anything more complicated, like loading and organizing MP3 files that you already have on your computer, then the going gets much tougher. The Gigabeat Room organizing software that comes on a CD with the unit leaves a lot to be desired, and very soon I was searching for, finding, downloading, and installing Version 3 of the Gigabeat Room software and firmware programs, which made life a bit easier.

The type of problems I encountered were that MP3 files could not be placed on Playlists from the Gigabeat Room software because they were invisible, or that sequential files (like a serialized book) had to be renamed so that they would play in the correct order. Or I want to add an MP3 track to a file on the Gigabeat, so I have to send it through Gigabeat Room whic h dumps it in the root directory on the Gigabeat 40, then open up a file handling program to place the track where I want it, then go back to Gigabeat Room and run a Library Refresh to get everything working right.

Musical items can be selected by album title, by genre, by artist, or by folder. The problem with the first three is that your menus soon get out of control, for example at the time of writing I have 59 albums loaded, but these contain 148 artists, and are listed under 21 genres. The names assigned to the genres are somewhat arbitrary,not to say bizarre, and may not help you find an album. For example, an album of latin music from Cuba is under "Caribbean", Basin Street Blues by Louis Armstrong is listed under "Club Dance", and an album of music from The King and I and Carousel is "Unclassifiable". Quite so!

(Amusingly, I have 2 CDs of Christmas carols one of which is listed under "Christmas" and the other under the more politically correct "General Holiday".)

Item #4 on the menu is called "Files" and this is what you really want, because now you can open up another program like Windows Explorer and organize your "Files" menu into a hierarchy that produces menus that are not too long. Example, my "Files" menu breaks into three types of files, one of which is "My Music". Under "My Music" are 7 subfolders entitled Rock, Jazz Albums, Jazz Collections, Blues, Musicals, Spanish, Christmas.

So now I can find my albums fairly easily, albeit at the expense of moving through several menus. However the screen is not particularly easy to read when you are picking out albums with similar titles, for example Jazz Masters Volume 1 versus Jazz Masters Volume 2.

It is thus annoying that you are not able to reorganize the menu so as to bring "Files" to the top.

None of this makes the device impossible to use, and with a bit of ingenuity you can work around most of these problems, but I am just writing some of this stuff so that you know that it may take a bit of time and effort to master the use of this machine and get it to do what you want.

2) Since the screen is about the size of a passport photo, it too small to meaningfully display photos. I would not buy it for this purpose. If you download photos from a digital camera you cannot immediately display them without further resizing and processing on your computer. You can, however, use it for blind storage.

3) It works well as an external drive.

So, it sounds as if I don't like the machine too much, but actually now that I have got the hang of it, I am getting to quite fond of it, and though I don't like listening through headphones, some of my music sounds stunning through the earbud headphones that come with this set. It is an amazingly convenient way to carry around my 250 CDs in a shirt pocket and means that I won't have CDs sliding around in my car any more.

On the other hand, I am not throwing away my CDs either. I have had some of them for 20 years, and somehow I doubt whether my Gigabeat will still be working in another 20 years, whereas I suspect my CDs will still be functional.

Here are a couple of tips that might be useful.

a) The Gigabeat is not compatible with the Apple i-Tunes online store, however if you buy music from there, you can convert it to MP3 with a program that records through your computer's sound card, then you can put it on the Gigabeat in the same way you transfer a podcast.

b) There is no car charger available for the Gigabeat, but I understand that the Sony PSP car charger will do the job.

c) Get the updated Version 3 software and firmware. You can call Toshiba for it

We all want our music portable these days and many manufacturer's realize this, hence, the mp3 player. I liked the cost of this machine when compared to other 40GB's on the market.  However, the manuals could be a little clearer for those of us who need lots of step by step photos to go through the first time. The manuals require you to flip back and forth between each of them. 

Toss the ear buds that come with them, unless you got ear canals like Dumbo or you want to tape them to your head. 

Overall, if you want lots of music to carry with you and don't want to pay Ipod prices, this is the way to go

This is my 7th MP3 player, I have this over two months and love it pretty much. However, there are some flaws for audio books. The major problem is sorting audio books. I ripped audio CDs with either Real Player or WMP11. I could get detail tags with Real but when I actually play, they are not the way it should be (per chapters). For example, the player sorted Harry Potter books in track numbers (I also tried with chapter #s). I could hear track 1, 10, 11, 12, ... 2, 3, 4, etc. This is very annoying. 

Another thing I don't like about this player is accompanied earphone. It has very good sound quality wirh remote control(compared to other players' accompanied earphones) but it won't stay in the ears. It fell off as soon as I moved my head! But the player doesn't skip even while I am running.

Other than these, the player is very good, not heay, good battery life, and great sound as well as good price (I paid $150 new). I used to like Creative 40 GB player but it was very bulky. The sound quality is almost the same. 

For Bookmark setting (for another reviewer below):

Go to "Set up" and "A-Button Function" and choose "Bookmark" so you can use A-Button on the right side of the player as your handy bookmark. You can resume your bookmark(s) from the same "Set up" and go to "Bookmark.

Product usage was quite easy to master within a few days of playing around with it and without reading the manual.
The software it comes with is also quite friendly and effective. Pulls songs information from the CDDB automatically, and can withdraw information for old songs on HD as well.

The only con is the hard time finding accessories for the gigabeat. Only case I could find was sold online.

Earplugs are also a bit uncomfortable, kept falling off.

Strongly recommend it for capacity, user friendliness and design

I bought this product for listening to music and to audiobooks, but it is absolutely useless for the latter, because it has no bookmark function. So if you've been listening to a long audio file, which is usually what audiobooks consist of, and you lose your place for any reason, you have to search forever to find where you were. And the fast forward only proceeds at one speed (the slowest), so it takes forever to get to where you thought you left off. The software interface is totally non-intuitive, and I constantly felt that I was fighting against it in transferring files to the player or finding them after they were transferred. Fortunately, I was able to return the player for a refund, even though Toshiba itself has a no returns policy for non-defective merchandise (but how does one define non-defective, this one is defective by design). Avoid buying this one. It stinks

First of all, for 40 Gigs, the price is unbeatable.  The Gigabeat is priced in the same range as the iPod Nano that can hold ten times LESS data.  Also, Gigabeat can handle pictures, which the Nano cannot.  The harware design is intuitive and easy to understand, and it's attractive, too.

However, I have some qualms with the audio quality.  I can hear a substantial amount of device noise during quieter songs, which is especially annoying for an audiophile like myself.  My only other mp3 player was a Creative Zen Micro, which was a bit clearer than my Gigabeat.  Not a huge beef, but something to consider.

Also, the interface is kind of ridiculous.  Music without any track information, like album, artist, or genre isn't even accessible through the device interface.  The only way to navigate through your music collection is by these classifications, and by some quirk, music without ANY classification doesn't even appear when "no information" is selected as the album, artist, or genre.  When The Gigabeat is plugged into the computer, all of the music is viewable, but only music with some track information is playable from the device interface.

Also, There is no "back" command once a track (album) has been selected.  In order to continue navigating from the album you were perusing when you selected the currently playing track, you must go all the way back to the beginning of the menu and start over.  When you were in the middle of the alphabet in a 200-album list, that becomes very tedious very quickly.  With no vertical or circular scrolling mechanism (it's one-at-a-time or press and hold for a few at a time), scrolling through long lists is slow and often inaccurate.

Picture viewing is fairly straightforward... except that it's sideways.  Took me a while to figure out that in order to navigate through the menu while in the photo folder, you must turn the device 90 degrees counter-clockwise, as the directional pad's functions literally change in this direction.  Other than that, the picture-viewing capability is well-implemented, except that there is no way to organize your pics; they just get dumped into one, big, communal folder.  Not a major complaint.

One thing I did appreciate is the free docking station, which also functions as a line-out ... and the ability to add tracks from any computer, using Windows Media Player.  These add an extra star on their own.  It also comes with a USB cable and earbuds with in-line volume control.  The docking station also has an extra USB-in jack, which enables you to use it without taking up one of your computer's USB inputs.

I recommend the Gigabeat purely because of its huge size-price ratio.  I also like the included extras.  I have my issues with it, but they're largely the result of my pickiness as a consumer.  The average buyer would probably not find fault quite so easily.  I give the Toshiba Gigabeat 3.5 stars out of 5, rounded up to 4

I didn't want to buy an ipod because they are so popular, so ubiquitous and seemed overpriced.

Boy was I wrong. 

Gigabeat:
Poor navagation
no support
no software updates
no firmware updates
no response to emails to toshiba
no usb 2 (unless you use their software which repeatedly crashes all running programs on the entire computer)
no worthwhile accessories
not great battery life

The software is terrible. Poor interface. Crashes frequently. Only way to transfer songs to the mp3 player at USB 2 speed (even windows media player can't transfer at USB 2 even though it is marketed as a windows media compatible device.) Who makes USB 2 non-compliant devices any more? Why cripple my device when the software crashes.

No Support. You can register at their site (supposedly) but it would never accept my code and repeated emails to Toshiba got no response. Even if you could get into the registered users website there is no software update and no firmware update (I found this out from another user.)

The only nice thing is the little attachment to headphones you can use to skip through songs when the thing is in your pocket.

The gigabeat was an expensive mistake - my poor husband has this thing now. He never uses it because the gigabeat is a pain to use and really really slow to load




ipod:
I was a contrary tech geek who didn't want to buy the big thing.
I was wrong.
I have one now. 
doesn't crash
good software with great interface
software and firmware updates
company support
podcasts are great - I never thought I'd use them - but I get stuff I love (including news, language lessons, radio, tv, and they are FREE.)
fabulous navagation. 
I never thought I'd use the video - but I do all the time. 
Surprizingly good battery life.
Great accessories -  really great accessories - I can record with one, it hooks up to stereos alarm clocks, newer car radios, you name it.

oh - and the ipod has never once crashed my computer

Sound quality is good compared to other flash based mp3 players. Difficult to manage songs. Whatever you put to it, you have to encrypt by the "Gigabeat Room" software provided. I thought it would work like flash drive, just copy from hard drive and run mp3 songs but unfortunately it does not work that way. Every songs is encrypted with .SAT extension so you cannot share your mp3 songs with your friends. Pictures are also encrypted and make double file with *.GBP extension and every file is renamed when encrypted. It took me a lot of time to figure out how to operate this player first time when I received it. I suggest not to buy it if you can spend a few bucks more for iPOD or Creative. Although Toshiba is making improvements in their new line of mp3 players that has video capabilities.

Admittedly, I was hesitant to order this machine after reading the negative comments here at Amazon.  I always give the customer reviews careful consideration before making a purchase of this size. I had already returned a samsung dvd player to a local retailer that promised "upconversion" and did not deliver.  I took a gamble with this Toshiba and I am happy that I did. I have it connected through HDMI to a Philips tv that has maximum 1080i resolution so i had hoped it would be a perfect pairing. The issue that had me scratching ny head was that my tv and the Toshiba are 1080i and yet Hd Dvds are a resolution of 1080p.  As this was a new technology I was wondering if the quality of the output would be compromised.  Welll, i'm here to tell you that it is NOT an issue.  The human eye can't really distinguish a difference unless perhaps you had a wide screen of maybe 50 inches or more.  The first film I watched was a Netflix rental of a standard dvd and the picture exceeded my hopes.  The enhanced black level setting can really amp up the look of a film, by the way, creating more depth an visual impact.  I also played an HD dvd that I bought from Amazon and the picture was spectacular.  To be very honest, the upconversion on some of the standard dvds I own is truly Near high definition.  I am sorry for those who have expressed regret in buying this player but I have to say that the HD-A1 is a formidable piece of equipment and the price is unbeatable.  Thank you Amazon

I thought I had a broken player but I simply didn't realize how incredibly sensitive these things are to a even a small smudge or part of a fingerprint.. let alone even a small scratch on the disk. Considering that this thing is really a fairly powerful computer inside the price is an absolute steal. Picture quality is just incredible. Support picks up on the fist ring! (when I didn't realize how sensitive the reader was to smudges I found that out) You can't get HD any better than this. Technically this thing only puts out 1080i but with a good 1080p TV with conversion you will never notice any difference, not even in a side by side comparision. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it takes too long to play both HD and normal DVDs which makes it not exactly and ideal replacement for a regular DVD player, but you do get used to it

I hooked the player to my Infocus X3 DLP projector via the component video cable I already use for an HD tuner and regular DVD player. When I tried playing an "upconverted" DVD, it refused to play above low resolution.  Digging into the manual, websites, etc., I found that ONLY the HDMI (digital) interface is guaranteed acceptable for high def play (it involves "copy protection"). Whether or not you can play any DVD --including HD DVDs-- in HD depends on the settings programmed onto the disk (it appears that most non-HD disks prohibit upconverting).

So I purchased new HDMI cables, adapters, plugs, switches...  Turned it on.. config screens looked good... started DVD... "HDMI ERROR 1".  I switched the HDMI cable to the HD receiver and the TV worked fine.  I then called Tech Support.  The gentleman listened attentively and quoted sections from the manual.  I asked for a little more information than what I had already read and was told that the tech support people had no other resources to work with.  I have applied the latest firmware update (each of the updates appears to be for an "HDMI error"). Apparently, I now have a $500 boat anchor.  Before buying any Toshiba HD-related product, be sure to do a google on "toshiba hdmi error". The postings by "HDMI authorities" are quite illuminating, if discouraging.

AS PROMISED THE PICTURE IS FANTASTIC. IT TAKES A WHILE UNTILL IT LOADS UP HOWEVER I DO NOT FIND THAT TO BE BOTHERSOME. YOU DO NEED A HDMI JACK ON YOUR TV OR IT WILL NOT OPERATE. THE ONLY NEGATIVE IS THE REMOTE WHICH I REALLY FIND DIFFICULT TO SEE AND UNTILL YOU START TO MEMORIZE THE BUTTONS ITS TROUBLING.  BUYING FROM AMAZON WAS A BREEZE AND SAVED ME A TIDY SUM AND SUBSEQUENTLY A PURCHASED A VIDEO RECEIVER! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!

I wanted to step up to HD DVD since I love dvd movies.  

Oh yes- the size is fine- not sure why they made a big deal of it. Remote ok- at night - you're screwed. get a universal remote. Fan noise- it's quieter than my xbox360.

I have a sony 42we655 rear LCD HDTV and picture is good. Wanted to see a huge improvement. Well my wife sees none but I do see the improvement. not sure it's the 4-5 times I expected. Looks great but maybe it's my tv. I'm connected via HDMI got Batman,Serenity,Corpse Bride, Constantine. 
Picture still has the bars on top and bottom but maybe I'm doing something wrong--got it on 16*9 already. HELP!!lol Picture looks great but seems like a super nice version of DVD. I don't know - looks great but I guess I was expecting to be blown really away. Got my 2.0 firmaware updated but maybe my tv is not the best of the best. Looks great but I think I'm messing up something. Any ideas???
For $399- you can't go wrong-

Don't get me wrong, staying on the cutting edge of technology affords bragging rights and gobs of ear and eye candy, however the exterior of this unit looks like it was manufactured in the 1980's.  Features, looks and specs will vastly improve with the '07 models across the board.  Just an observation while you drop your hundreds here

Ok so I should have read the fine print, but it turns out that even though HD DVD's are all encoded at 1080p, the players only support 1080i and 720p.  I think I will return mine and wait for a true HD DVD

The best part is that you can upgrade the firmware directly.. I recently upgraded it to 2.0 and now it does play Dolby - True HD in 5.1 format. I watch the HD-DVD on 62In Toshiba 1080P and picture is awesome. 
Just wish that the startup time was faster , it takes arround 50 secs to start and play HD-DVD

I bought my floor model HD-A1 9/4 (Rex Store closing :( ) and have used it to enjoy 20 DVDs - both HD and regular.  I am amazed at the picture quality for both, but especially the HDs.  I have seen Blue Ray demos in Best Buy, Sears, etc., and the picture quality cannot compete with the HD-A1. While this may change in the future, for now, HD kicks BR butt.  "Sound and Vison" magazine had a detailed article on the Toshiba DVD players, and can also be referenced on their web site.
     The HD-A1 is a pc, so slowness in turning on and off, stopping play, etc. is tolerable for me.  I would guess that will improve with future software and hardware updates.  It is neat that I can update the software by plugging my HD-A1 into my DSL - quick and easy, or Toshiba will send these to you on disk.
     Remote is not user friendly as functions of keys are hard for my eyes to see, and it is not lit.
     HD-DVD selection is getting better, but not being able to see films from other than Universal and Paramount studios is crazy.  SONY is responsible for this (remember the Beta vs VHS war)??  Hopefully this will also change.
     Amazon has great selection and best prices I've seen, especially if you opt for their 10% off option.  Used HD DVDs are also becoming more available here.
     If you like HD quality TV shows, you'll love HD DVDs and this player from Toshiba

In August I purchased the Toshiba HD-DVD player. Not only do HD-DVDs look great, but ALL DVDs look great. I would rank both HD and SD (standard definition) DVDs as superior in picture quality to HD-TV channels. This is because of the upconversion ability which converts 480i standard definition DVDs to 1080i. Even though HD-TV channels broadcast in either 720p or 1080i,
their signal is still compressed and often "noisy". I recently viewed the
remastered Blade Runner, an SD disc upconverted to 1080i by my player, and it looked fantastic---the best version of Blade Runner I've ever seen. So I
don't hesitate to watch ANY DVD on the Toshiba. It would be worth the purchase price just for its' rendering of standard DVDs

I love this kit! It sounds oh-so-good! I especially love the fact that you can change the adapter plug on the casette adapter from front-loading to side-loading. Very convenient! I also like all of the voltage adapters, I have used it to charge my cell phone as well as operate my CD player. 

As for the other reviews listed, I don't know why they would rate it negatively at all. One said the casette adapter didn't come with it, he obviously got the wrong item. As far as the one that said the fuse blew, I would have first checked the voltage regulator in my car...

Highly recommended product

I don't have any problem with the adapter and the sound quality is good. In my opinion, it deserves 4.5 stars. Actually most of the bad reviews here for this product are not fair. At least one should not complain about a product because he/she couldn't receive it from a retailer or received a wrong product. He/She should point his/her finger to the retailer, instead

I wanted to buy a Car Kit to listen to my MD player inside my car.  After browsing around the web, I found this Coby Car Kit Adapter which had everything I needed at a good low price.  I ordered it immediately.  After it arrived, I plugged the adaptor in my cigarette lighter to test it out and the fuse burned out.  I was going to send it in to the manufacturer but realized that they actually charge you 10$ shipping and handling on this item.  Thus, I just took it apart and realized it was only the fuse and bought another one at radio shack and it seems to be working fine right now.  Besides that, the sound quality isn't too bad

***REVISED*** 10/13/06 (see bottom)

When I got them they where "black ash" as advertised (amazon pic from JBL website) but the woofers have a metallic look to them as well as the front main trim. I guess the picture is taking at a bad angle to the light or something. The woofers are no-ware near as black as in the picture (I think they look better actually).

Ok onto the good stuff, man good speakers for this price they are where it's at. I'm a fan of JBL but not their price that's why I buy online and at discount. These speakers much like the newer L830 have a great mid range and a fine clear top end. The low is pretty nice as well, it sounds realistic like I'm actually listening to a bass guitar, piano, or chello. The dynamic range is vary good and they don't discriminate individual tones, you can hear instruments and off tones clearly. The vocals are clear as well, nice and pronounced. They image well (I guess is the word)you have to get over to one side of the set up before you notice an imbalance of the sound (in a big room mind you). When watching a movie it's like I'm in the theater minus the surround sound. They are a good solid par of speakers. 

Some bad things, I've been listening to them for a little while now and decided to hook up one of my KLH 970A to the center channel on my receiver. Well now it sounds perfect, they seem to lack the "front or middle" vocal definition for tv/movies when placed a normal tv distance apart (say over 3-5 feet). A center channel (or small high Hz speaker) really rounds them off and makes them sound complete. Also, there is no lack of deep lows. Unless you really want to hear some rumbling a sub-woofer is almost not needed. They are relatively heavy (25 Lb each). You would need good sturdy shelves/stands that can take weight at the edge. They are pretty big, well not big but shaped a little odd, you almost have stand them on their side if your putting them in the corner of a smaller room. That's about, other than physical things it's a top notch speaker. I haven't played everything through them or as loud as I dare but I have liked what i've herd so fare...

(All this was done in a 10x10x8H room with a Yamaha HTR-5940 useing 18 guage wire, two conductor, all copper speaker wire with chepo banna plugs all around.

***REVISE*** 10/13/06
In big rooms.
I recently had a chance to try them out in a good sized room. I didn't take a measurement but I would guess around 25x30 feet, with part of the ceiling high (maybe 14 feet) and angled, the other part (where the speakers where) was about 10 feet. The room was sort of two rooms the low room cut into the big one blah blah blah the room was shaped odd, and they still sounded good with less echoing than you would think. This room was bare, only had half finished cabinets and a hard wood floor

I was replacing floor speakers and wanted a pair of speakers which had a smaller footprint (my wife didn't want a room filled and dominated with speakers)...yet still provided performance.  I got what I wanted by purchasing the JBL E50.

I am using the speakers primarily as the front main channels (5.1 configuration) in a room that is 15'x15' with a 10'ceiling plate.  The room is filled well with sound.  The audio is clean and provides good spatial depth to the movie sound tracks.  This in tandem with the other (center, subwoofer) JBL Northridge speakers.

Playing music from my CD player....sounds good and inviting.  Good definition.  Good reproduction.

I believe I made the right choice and very pleased with my purchase.  I would recommend JBLs

I have been a JBL fan for years.  I am a professional Audio Engineer, and I am familliar with the tonality and durability of JBL products.

I purchased a pair of JBL Northridge E50 bookshelf speakers to do a shootout with a pair of Polk Monitor 40 speakers for a client I am desigining a home stereo install for.  The client paid approximately $250 delivered for each pair of speakers.

After several days of testing within tolerances, I could still differentiate between the two, but it became nearly impossible for the client to tell which speaker was which in a blindfold test.  Both television and CDs were tested through the speakers, and the music ranged from Josh Grobin to Stevie Ray Vaughn.  It should be noted that the Polk Monitor 40s and the JBL E50s both required the use of a subwoofer in order to sound complete.  By sheer weight, the JBL wins hands-down.  At 25-lbs. each, it is a much heavier box than the 17-lb. Polk.

Through much of our testing, the 3-way JBL seemed more transparent in it's tonality, but when switched back and forth between the 2-way Polk within the same piece of music, it sometimes sounded a bit mid-rangey through the 800-1600 Hz range.  I'm not sure whether the Polk was missing through that range, or whether the JBL was adding, but the Polks sounded more like what I was hearing in the AKG headphones.  Also, the JBLs seemed to be lacking a bit in the lower range, through the 60-160 Hz range.  This was the most surprising result, because the 8" woofer in the JBL looks as though it should be kicking the tail of the Polk 6" dual woofers, but the Polks had a deeper, richer bottom end.

The JBL E50s are rated for greater power than the Polk Monitor 40s, so if you plan to rock the house, the JBLs are probably a better choice.  When pressed to their Continuous Power Handling rating, the Polks began to sound as though they were suffering from distress.  They didn't distort, but they were obviously uncomfortable, while the JBLs never winced.  However, for the purpose of this comparison, my client stated that the listening area (15 ft. X 20 ft.) would never tolerate that much volume, and confessed he would never be listening to the JBLs as loud as they were tested, so keep in mind the space where you will be using them.

In the end, it was decided that the Polk Monitor 40s were smoother and did not inject their own tonality onto the music.  The JBL E50s would have required a physical change to the shelf on which they were to reside, so the client made the choice for the Polk Monitor 40s, but if you have a good sturdy shelf with room for the E50, and a listening space large enough to turn them up, you may make a different choice

The build quality is excellent and the E50s image well.  The sound is warm and smooth, very easy to listen to.  Bass response is adequate but not strong.  The treble could use a bit more air as well.

Since the E50s are bookshelf speakers, they seem best suited for a small to medium sized room or for use as surround speakers.  If used as main speakers for a large room, I suggest adding a separate subwoofer.  Overall, an excellent speaker at this price point

These batteries are fantastic !
What I'm pissed about is the $150 i've spent on replacement bateries over 2 years in the 6 handsets I have. Why has panasonic waited so long to come out with a replacement battery that will hold a charge ?
The only thing worse than dealing with my past battery problems would have been if I had given or thrown away my phone systems just before these NiMH batteries came out.

I wasn't sure of the size and was expecting a very large keyboard but it's not and fits nicely in my lap which makes it comfortable to type fast.   The keys are a little smaller (not much) than my last keyboard so I was a little thrown off when I started to type.  I'm a pretty big guy 6' and could see if you had big hands this might be a problem.  I really like this keyboard especially at this price I wouldn't expect more.  The keys are comfortable.  The layout of the short cut keys are perfect at the top and don't interfere with typing regular text and they don't take up space on the keyboard.

I got one of these at work a few months ago (I'm a full-time programmer).  I like it a lot.  It has good action, is quiet, has standard placement for the cursor control keys between the numeric keypad and the regular keys (2 rows of 3, not 3 rows of 2 like many others).

I didn't install the drivers from the CD, but many of the functions still work (XP pro), like volume, mute, email, browser.  I don't use them that much, but now that I'm buying one for home, maybe I'll get more used to them.

I like the fact that there aren't a zillion buttons to choose from like some others, so you don't get overwhelmed and don't have to look for what you want.

I really don't think you can beat it for the price (usually under $15). 

The only bad thing is that when you reboot, you need to press a button to enable the standard function keys at the top (there's a  light that tells you when it's enabled).  I often forget, but the first time it doesn't work, I remember.  I don't really use them that much anyway - mainly just F5 for refresh

This is a nice keyboard. I believe it is the most inexpensive Logitech model.  The good news is that Logitech doesn't make junk.  It's slightly tweaked from a standard keyboard, in that keyboard is not inclined upward but horizontal.  There is a also a plastic wrist-rest that attaches to the front of the keyboard.  These changes I believe are supposed to make typing more comfortable since your wrists are no longer twisted upwards.  I am experimenting using the keyboard with and without the wrist-rest; I think it largely depends on the height of the chair you are sitting in--if your chair is high enough, then the wrist-rest is good, if your chair is lower, the wrist-rest leaves your wrists uncomfortably high.  There are some other slight differences in the keyboard; the 1st row of keys (spacebar, control, alt, etc.) are tapered toward the front of the keyboard, I assume for ergonomic reasons.  I like the feel of the keyboard; it requires only a light touch.  It is also fairly quiet i.e. no loud clicking.  The only things I don't like are minor--the function keys must be enabled using a F-lock key--however they stayed locked for the remainder of the time the computer is on.  I also couldn't get the software to work--the one that is supposed to map various keys to things like e-mail, your internet home page, etc.  I don't really care about that, so I didn't really try very hard to get it to work--it probably would have if I persisted.  I also had some problems de-installing the drivers--when I removed them, the keyboard wouldn't work.  I had to reinstall the drivers again.  The keyboard worked OK in Debian Linux (Sarge/3.1), as well as Windows.  The keyboard looks attractive enough, although the wrist-rest if charcoal and the keyboard off-white so they don't match.  In all, an excellent keyboard for the price

I previously had a keyboad that came with my computer it was horrible none of the number keys would work.  I would have to pound on it to get it to work.  So i just broke that keyboard.  I was in search of a new one so I looked around on amazon and found this keyboard i decided yo buy it because it was only 12 bucks so if i didnt like it wat the heck i would buy a 20 buck one. So i recently recieved the keyboard and i love it. It looks great it feels great the keys are very soft to the touch. Everything!!! is labeled i can do anything from my keyboard i can send my email i can reply i can open aol instan messenger i can change the song i can fastforward! I can turn up the volume turn it down i can mute it i can open my email i can open my music i can open my internet! I can even open my computer, my documents, my pictures, and my music. Also many of the keys r labeled such a y is redo u is underline. i is italic c is copy and etc.. This makes everything very fast and easy! I love this keyboard. also my previous keyboard wire was barely long enough this one is more than enough. Same with my logitch 3 button optical mouse that thing is great.  Logitech makes great products.  Oh and the thing about the start buttons like if ur doin something and u accidently hit that button all u have to do is take a screw driver and pull of that key than it wont happen anymore.  But with this keyboard since the outer buttons are curved down like space and such you rarely accidentally hit those buttons annymore. It also has a button that locks all the f keys which is quite useful.  I love this keyboard and i HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT. Oh and one more thing when ever you press one of the like f buttons or email or media buttons it brings it up in green on you screen what you just pressed and its GREAT!!!!! I highly recommend buying this product!

I got this Logitech Deluxe Keyboard for my new computer and I am suprise at the quality of this product. It's under $15 from amazon. It's very...very quiet!!!!!..It also has many other useful things like Web and Media controls[Window Media Player Controls]. You can go on the web or check emails with a touch of a botton. Simply a great product for so little money. I buy 90% of the stuff I need on internet(from about 10 major internet stores), but Amazon is still the BEST INTERNET STORE OVER ALL..

I compared the Bose 321 Series II system with the Sony and Denon 2.1 systems.  No comparison in terms of sound quality.  Denon and Sony have some very nice features but if your goal is sound quality then you can't beat Bose.  The system is very easy to setup and use.  If you don't have room for rear channel speakers or don't want to run wires all over the room 2.1 systems are the way to go, but keep in mind they are not true surround sound.  This system is also very good for just listening to music and has a decent AM FM tuner

I submitted an image above.  The Bose 3-2-1 delivers realistic sound which makes watching any show or movie a much better experience.  We always were satisfied with our mediocre HD TV speakers.  But this Bose 3-2-1 system delivers such clear sound effects, music and speech that I couldn't believe what we had been missing.  Because of this great sound improvement we started watching action movies, concerts and other programs that we'd never seen.  The Acoustimass� module vibrates our wood floor and the two speakers create amazing sound clarity.  Even faint sound effects are easily picked up with these speakers.  This system doesn't knock your walls down with the thuds and exaggerated sound effects that some Home Theater systems use.  Instead, because the Bose sound is so real, sometimes people think that the speaker noise is coming from outside our house

Bought this system back in December 2005.  Two weeks later the center unit started skipping on any DVDs or CDs.  Sometimes it just turned itself off while trying to read a DVD.  I brought it back to a retail store for exchanging.  This "exact" same problem did happen to the replacement too.  The system is now at one of the Bose repair centers.  I hope they could get it all straight out this time :

I initially had a Series I 321, and recently upgraded it to a Series II.  For me, the 321 systems are great in principle, and until fairly recently, there really wasn't much in the way of competition in terms of simplicity and portability.  With new competition from Sony and Denon, however, I'd say the 321 has become less compelling, and you'd do well to shop around a bit.

That said, the 321 Series II is very nicely designed for what it is.  It is unobtrusive and the controls are very nicely laid out.  The sound is good, but not excellent.

I have had quality issues with the Series II, but to the credit of Bose, they are very much standing by their product.  I'm in the process of exchanging my SECOND system since upgrading in December.  Although that has been frustrating, their customer service has been outstanding.  I can call a toll free number and talk to a real person with minimal waiting.  Most importantly, they take what I say seriously, and have not jerked me around at all; for both exchanges they paid shipping both ways.

If I could do it over again I would look hard at the Denon S101, or even consider buying separate components, but at the end of the day there's something about the Bose design that I really like.  Whereas most HTIB systems are gaudy in appearance, the Bose is elegant and simple by comparison.  And, even though I've had some quality issues, I have never had such a good experience dealing with customer service in the electronics industry.  That goes a long way for me, and accordingly I gave this four stars

This Bose system is great and completely lives up to the Bose name.  We installed this system in our family room which is long and narrow and difficult to run speaker wires.   We had a traditional Home Theatre system with the 5 speaker and bass set up and we were not satisifed.  First of all, the system was so complicated to set up that we never felt we were fully utilizing it's capabilities and it sometimes didn't function as we felt it should!  Secondly, you had to hassle with all the speaker wires run everywhere!  We decided to invest in this Bose system and it is GREAT!  Simple set up and operation and the sound literally fills the room.  We first heard the Bose system at a Sam's club and if the acoustics can sound good in a warehouse setting, imagine how good it can sound in your home!  Well worth the money and so simple to set up that a child could do it

With hardwood floors and a lofted ceiling, running wires for a surround system was out of the question. The Bose 3-2-1 system was a nice alternative. Great sound (not quite surround sound) and stylish apperance. Very easy to hook up but a bit pricey

Like many other reviewers, I bought this unit with the intent of being able to play my ipod softly while working. However, there is not "soft" volume on this at all. If you're in a quiet office, it is much too loud to even turn on.

Everything else about the iBoom is good. I am happy with it and will be able to use it in my bathroom while getting ready for work. 

But if you're looking only for something for the office, do not buy this, look for alternatives.

From a variety of sources, one might conclude the DLO iBoom has construction issues that might make other iPod playable units more attractive. While the unit visibly appears to be plasticky, the iBoom's overall construction seems to be more than adequate to stand up to what it was designed for--simple indoor and outdoor listening pleasure.

My iPod Nano slipped right into the iBoom's receptacle and once the batteries/AC cord was in place, the tunes came flowing out. Indoors, you're not going to mistake the iBoom's sound quality for upper end units that qualify as table top radios (SoundWave, Tivoli or Cambridge, for instance). And you might take some umbrage to DLO's hype of the unit providing "room filling" sound. Nope...not there; however, music from "The Thomas Crown Affair," Norah Jones, and "Phantom of the Opera" have all been crisp and well defined with satisfactory highs, midtones, and lows. Nothing earth shattering, mind you, but quite acceptable.

The FM radio tuner could definitely stand some rethinking. The unit does not automatically stop when it comes to a receivable station, so you must manually fiddle with the in between stops to locate a station worth listening to. Even then, I found the iBoom's FM reception to be marginal. 

If the iBoom's FM unit is not up to your listening standards, the AUX input allows for the connection of another audio source. My Pioneer XM radio plugs in nicely with a 1/8" male-to-male connector, giving the iBoom an added dimension that far surpasses local FM listening choices.

In the iBoom's next incarnation, the designers should give some consideration to a removable power cord. I was able to get both the batteries and AC cord to coexist with no problem, but that power cord is like the proverbial puppy dog's tail that just wanders along with you without being able to really stored...unless you want to remove the batteries. 

I hope all you dads had a Great Father's Day. My iBoom has contributed to my day

i am very happy with this purchase.  I actually bought two, one for each of my teenage daughters.  very rich sound, good base, and very sleek and neat looking.  they each have the mini ipod, with no problem with the fit.  it would be nice to have additional radio presets, however, i bought the unit really for ipod use.  considering how they blast their music, perhaps more station choices is not such a great idea.  This is a very nicely made product, and can be used inside or out.  So far........so goo

Many people have complained about the sound quality of this item. Before I purchased mine, I actually tried one out with my own iPod and was reasonably impressed. It's not a concert-hall system by any stretch of the imagination. It's a *boom-box*, a way to take your music with you and play it so that everyone can hear. It does that job quite well. It's no worse than my car stereo - which is also not a concer-hall system.

 In fact, it does its job so well that we might have to buy another one because my 13yo daughter keeps borrowing mine.

The one complaint we have with it is the volume control. As you get to the lower levels, it suddenly drops off into nothingness. This problem can be solved by using the iPod's own volume control when you want to get to the really low ranges, but still, they could've made this work a little more smoothly.

People have also complained about the battery compartment, but we'll probably never use this with batteries, so it's not an issue for us. We just love the fact that we can move this from room to room with our iPods.

Sure, it could be better, and that's why I waited until the price dropped from its original $150. But for $90 it's good enough

We purchased the MD7081 and the extra handset MD7001. The cost is very competitive and the styling is better than most sets we looked at. From an aesthetic point of view, the MD7081 base is a little on the bulky side and has to sit flat on a surface, no wall-mounting ability. The handset is great. The rubber grips on the side are nice to the touch and the short antenna is a great feature. The orange LCD display is quite attractive while the phones' menu navigation is intuitive and easy to scroll though.

The only issues we have with the handsets are the phone buttons. A few of the number buttons are a little "sticky" so you have to press them more firmly than usual. The biggest problem we've found is when switching and hanging up between lines and conferencing calls. If you're on line 1 and line 2 rings and you want to hang up 1 to pick-up 2 you have to hit "cancel" on 1 then switch over to 2. It's just an extra step. If you don't hit cancel it keeps line 1 in use. We've gotten done with a call and placed the phone on the base only to find that 10 minutes later one of the lines is still in use because we didn't hit cancel. The other item is that there isn't a separate hold button. You can place a call on hold by pressing the menu button while on a call. Again, just not intuitive. On a positive note, the hands-free and speakerphone features work really well. 
Overall we're really happy with these phones. The range and clarity are top notch and we'd buy them again if we had to. There's just a slightly higher learning curve with this phone than ones I've used in the past

Overall, we are quite pleased with our purchase of the base unit and three additional handsets.  Quite simple to install.

A minor problem is that the batteries don't seem to last very long.  Fortunately, they do seem to recharge quickly.

One stupid design flaw is that when paging another handset, the handset from which you are paging also emits the loud paging tone.  Quite stupid and very annoying.

Well built and quality construction, except for the numbers on the handset.  They are too small.

Despite these complaints, I doubt you will find a better two-line multi-handset cordless phone.  Especially for the price

I replaced an aging Siemens 2.4Ghz two line system with the Motorola 7081 and three additional handsets. Our Siemens 2.4Ghz unit had noise trouble after we installed a 2.4Ghz wireless router. It would freq shift right onto the wireless network freq and cause dropout and line noise. This made the phone system unusable. I've been looking for a solid 5.8Ghz multi-line phone system for almost a year to avoid upgrading the wireless network to 5.8Ghz :-) The MD7081 has really worked out nicely. The sound quality is good (not great). The feature set in the phone is complete and no issues with the 2.4Ghz wireless network. The handsets feel solid, the Siemens phone were solid but the buttons on the handsets would fail after heavy use from the five heavy phone users in our home :-) The jury is still out on the Motorola handset buttons. 

PRO's
1. Solid feel to the handset.
2. Easy setup, much easier then Siemens unit.
3. Works well with 2.4Ghz wireless network.
4. Remote voice mail, voice mail pickup on each handset.

CON's
1. Doesn't use AA rechargable batteries in handsets.
2. Handset charger cord is short.
3. Handset does not automaticly answer phone when handset removed from charger

Others have commented on the major weaknesses of this phone, but I'll add my own pet peeve: everything is so bl**dy SLOW! To scroll down through the phone book feels like click-pause-click-pause-click-pause.... Each handset defaults to private phone book use, so to switch to the shared phone book involves a couple of button-pushes, each of which takes ages to respond. And don't try getting ahead of it: your button pushes may or may not be recognized.

What a piece of junk

I replaced all of the 'phones in my home with one base unit and 4 handsets. I love the fact that I can place a fully functional 'phone with access to both of my 'phone lines anywhere there's a electrical outlet. My 2nd 'phone line is wired only to my home office, so I placed the base unit there and now I can pick up the 2nd line anywhere in my home.

Some pros:
* Every handset ringer can be customized. The 'phones have a ring schedule feature that allows one to set the "day volume" and "night volume" on each line on each handset. One can set the time that the "day" and "night" volumes start.
* The answering system also provides a "day" and "night" outgoing message for each line.
* Reception is incredible. It sounds like I'm on a wired 'phone even in my back yard.
* The "shared phone book" is a wonderful feature. Once one adds a  contact to the shared book, it's available on all of the handsets immediately.
* Each handset also has a "private phone book" feature, in case you'd like to have some contacts programmed only on (for example) your kitchen handset.
* If you have Caller ID and Name, this information can be placed into your contact list very quickly and easily
* The handsfree quality is extremely good on the base unit and the handsets
* The intercom feature is extremely nice - you can page any other specific handset, or all handsets.
* It's very nice to be able to see at a glance whether you've got messages, without having to go into the room where the answering machine is. Every handset becomes your answering machine.

Some cons:
* Setting up the day and night volumes on each handset can be a bit tedious. I didn't find a way, for example, to silence temporarily all of the ringers on all handsets (say for when I want to take a nap). There may be a way to do this, but I've just not found it
* Manually entering contacts into the contact list is also tedious (if you don't have caller ID/name)
* There doesn't seem to be a way to expand the memory for the answering machine. 30 minutes just isn't enough.
* Accessing the contact lists is tedious - you have to know the slot number. If you don't, you have to scroll - and it's fairly slow

Overall, I'm very pleased with this system, and recommend it

This phone was everything it was reported to be with one exception. The wall mount feature causes the phone to sit too high for any standard wall mount jack. Also the wall mount had the phone extending out from the wall much more than a atandard wall mounted phone would be. These problems stem from the design which is truely a desk model type of phone.
Wall mountable 2-line phones with answering capabilities are very scarse. Only 2 manufacturers were found to make acceptable models specifically designed for the wall: Sony and AT&T

I do not recommend Apple's Ipod and IF you are going to buy one, get the extended warranty. Over the past 3.5 years, I have owned three Ipods and all three died with the same problem after about a year....the well known folder with the exclamation mark.  At first it is fixable by restoring or resetting the device, but then the hard dive siezes up and you have a paper weight.  I have done this three times because I own all the accessories including by beloved Bose docking station.  

If you doubt my warning here, just check out Apple's Ipod support page on their web site.  Right on the first page are the infamous icons that you will dread to see on Ipod (if you buy one).  Also check out the support discussion board. 

You've been warned

This mp3 player has great sound quality with the ear buds provided. We had a problem with the first refurbished one we bought.  It suddenly froze up and could not be restarted.  We had great service from our provider who replaced it very speedily with another newer one.  It seems to be working just fine so far.  We are very happy with the capacity of storage and functionality of the Apple product. Very smooth operation and intuitive function

Ok, so if you are the average consumer, such as myself, you probably have an mp3 player of some sort. If you own an Apple iPod, then you and I along with 58 million other unsuspecting consumers have been had. BIG TIME. I too fell into the trance of the white earbuds, but no longer will I remain an Apple lemur. I bought a 4th generation iPod and was so excited that I too was going to be sporting the ultimate in mp3 players!! Boy, was I STUPID!!! I commute to Boston on the commuter rail, which is about a forty-minute ride into town, switch to the subway for 10 minutes, and then walk to my building in about 3 minutes. I am not a runner so when I say walk it's a stroll. Nothing aggressive. After about 2 and � months with my new toy, the problems began. Freeze ups began to occur in the middle of playing songs. 

This happened everyday for a few months. I sought help from Apple at their website and performed all steps they suggest to get the iPod back on the straight and narrow. I reset it (lost all my music every time I did this), then a few months later I kept receiving a folder icon with exclamation point. I went back to the Apple website, in which I was a regular visitor, and followed their instructions for the new error (Put iPod into disk mode and reinstall the driver hardware). This happened on and off for the next few months along with the freezing thing. Then the biggie of all biggies started to happen after just one year of ownership. I got, what I thought was cute at the time, a picture of an iPod on my screen with a sad face telling me to contact Apple Support. 

I proceeded to contact an iPod specialist using the phone number provided by Apple. The first thing I heard that disgusted me was my 90-day warranty was up and now had to either buy an Apple Care plan for $99.00 and have support from them for two years or pay a $50 per incident fee. Immediately I asked why as it was to my understanding that iPod was covered for 1 year from the date of purchase. I was told that yes this was correct but phone support was 90 days only. If my iPod needed service, I would have to create an account on their website and issue a request for service. I was floored by the lack of help right from the get go. You get three months to have a problem with your brand new almost $300 dollar purchase, and then you are told go away to no -man's land and submit a request, because unless you pay $50 or $99.00, human contact is not an option. 

After steaming for a few moments, I realized I still had a broken iPod to fix. I proceeded to no-man's land and filled out my service request. I sent Apple my player and waited a couple of weeks for a response. Needless to say, I could have waited forever because the answer they gave was and still is unacceptable. My $299.00 technological marvel, my portable music librarian, my expensively priced modern convenience's hard drive had failed. I was out of warranty by a week or two. I inquired about the cost for repair. $268.40 to bring it back from the dead. "ARE YOU KIDDING ME!" I screamed into the poor person's unsuspecting ear on the phone. The tech said he gets that a lot and I proceeded to tell him I understood why people scream. He told me the best thing to do would be to buy another unit since the cost was comparable, in fact a bit cheaper at $249.00 and I would have a new updated unit. So, being a stupid sucker for punishment, I went out and spent $250 dollars on another 4th generation iPod. I intended to buy one as a gift for my boyfriend anyway for his birthday so this justified the purchase for me. I chalked up my lousy experience to a one-time glitch. Couldn't happen again type of thing. Well, guess what? Please read on...

He started to commute to work and after leaving the iPod in the box for months, he decided now was the time to use his new gadget. He only used it when he walked the 1 mile to and from the subway stop to work. Total 2 miles a day, walking. Needless to say, 6 months of light use and I had another stupid, little, annoying iPod picture with its brainless sad face staring back at me. It was like looking at a kid who just broke an expensive vase and could do nothing but be sorry about it. 

This time, I thought I was going to get a bit of a break. After all, Apple opened up an Apple Store in a mall close to work. No need to send out the unit. I could get my painful diagnosis in person. So I make an appointment online, as you can't do that over the phone (you know they hate that human contact thing) and I show up to the "Genius Bar" to meet the iPod Genius. This guy had the T-shirt that said he was in fact an "iPod Genius".  I hand over the little devil and he then proceeds to tell me what I already knew. HARD DRIVE FAILURE. I never really delved into why this cataclysmic event happened the first time with the tech guy from Apple regarding my unit, so, I figured after spending $600 on 2 products in a bid to help build Apple's employee retirement fund, I wanted some legitimate answers. I then proceed to ask the so called  "iPod Genius" why this keeps happening, explaining that this is the second iPod I had purchased in a 2.5 year span and they BOTH did the same exact thing. He then went on to explain that it is a hard drive player and if it is jostled around too much, it eventually fails. He then pointed out a tiny little scratch it had received on the bottom back and said "this player took a fall. Once that happens, it's only a matter of time before failure occurs." I then explained that it may have fallen out of my hands once but it was at waist level and fell onto a kitchen floor. Hardly an abusive drop. I was not slamming the thing around like King Kong and neither was my boyfriend. The "Genius" then said that just stepping off the curb the wrong way when a song is playing or changing to another song will eventually cause hard drive failure.  I then said to the "Genius" "It states on Apple's website that you can use iPod for exercise, it's a great workout companion. My boyfriend and I only WALKED with it and it got jostled enough to DIE?" So what you are telling me is you CANNOT run, walk, possibly talk, step off curbs (guess you have to float or fly), NEVER drop it, or move it around whatsoever because any or all of these events can jostle it and cause it to fail? So, stand perfectly still or pay $268.40 to repair it or $249.00 to buy a new one?" Of course, the "Genius" sat there dumbfounded and had no response. 

IS APPLE SERIOUS!!! What the H#&L kind of product are they selling to consumers? They market a portable product that needs rubber padding and a steel casing just to be able to use it. The "Genius" however, did offer me 10% off a purchase of another iPod with trade in of the old one. Did he really think I was going to fall into the white earphone trance for the third time? Apple should be ashamed of their business practices. But then again, why would they even care? People think mp3 the first thing they think of is iPod. EDUCATE YOURSELF!! Do the research and turn away from the light!! If the product that they sell is that sensitive, then it should be marketed accordingly with a statement such as: "product needs to be securely fastened to the wall for use." I am totally disgusted and of course Apple is of no help, as it would affect their bottom line. People please take my advice. Upgrade you phone to an mp3 player when your "upgrade time comes you can usually do this for WAY less than an iPod, check other companies such as Creative and iRiver for their players and only use Apple for what they should be used for.

In our household we have three fourth generation iPods.  A 20g, 40g and 60g.  All three have been sent back for service.  The 20g and the 40g were still under warranty, but because the service was required after a six-month timeframe, a 29.95 (plus tax) shipping fee applied.

What happened with the 20g (after about 11 months of using it) was it just froze up in that stupid frowning face mode.  A very annoying way of letting you know you ain't gonna here no music no more without shipping it off to California for service.  So off it went and Apple did have it back in a total turnaround time of about four days.  Got it back and it is working fine.

The 40g hard drive took a crap on me.  Frowning face and weird, high-pitch squeal coming from the unit.  Can't be good.  Here goes another 29.95 (plus tax) to fix this one after about 7 months of use.

The 60g unit had the same problem as the 20g model.  But the problem showed its ugly face after 5 months and 15 days, so I got totally free shipping (no tax).  Such a deal.  Have been using the unit for about three weeks now and it is skipping songs and freezing up for no real reason.  Also it stutters on the start of many songs...is this a problem with the cache?  Don't know, but I do know that it is out of the six month grace period for free shipping.

All in all, the iPods in out house are great when they work right.  But the problems with all three lead me to the conclusion that I would not recommend any iPod to anybody.  There seems to be real quality problems that Apple should 

When my three iPods die for the final time, I will trash them and look for alternatives.  Maybe it is not realistic to expect to hold 10,000 - 15,000 songs in such a small unit.  Looks as though I may have to go back to using my Sony CD/MP3 player.  I guess 14 hours of music on one CD is something I will learn to live with again.  I did get spoiled by the thought of holding my ever-expanding music library on the iPods.

For the price and the problems I have had with three separate iPods, I would advise anybody to look elsewhere

I bought a so called 'new' Ipod..... And I've had  problems ever since. For starters, Itunes is almost useless, and of course that's the only music program your able to use to do ANYTHING to your Pod, strike one. 

Every tutorial I've read and tried didn't fix my problems. And that consisted of 1) restarting my PC 2) reinstalling Itunes, 3) resetting my Pod. Nothing worked, nothing will. Strike two

The fact that you are almost forced to buy a new Pod if  you encounter problems, unless you wanna spend hundreds to repair it. And you can't repair anything yourself. Third and final strike.

Is the Ipod worth buying? No. Is it a good gift? Yes.... If you hate the person your buying it for that is.

Buy a Sony MP3 player, or the new Microsoft player. Thoese would most definitely be better buy

Corrupt iTunes Library nightmare--

This year some bug in iTunes corrupted my iTunes song library. This is not an uncommon problem; if you search google you will find hundreds of hits related to this problem if you do a search for the following three words: iTunes corrupt library

When your iTunes library is corrupted that means every playlist you have created is gone and the links to all of the songs you owned are gone. Playlists are like folders or directories on a computer into which you put songs to organize them so that you don't have to navigate through all of your songs, albums, artists, etc., one by one.  If you have hundreds of songs this is a big hassle when using an iPod if you want to go to one that may be way down on the list. You then have to manually import these songs back in and recreate your playlists. This has been a problem with iTunes for ages.  You can backup your library and given that iTunes is unstable and may corrupt your library, this may be a good idea.  If you like solving software problems iTunes is the way to go.

Unstable iTunes internet server destroys your shopping cart list nightmare--

One feature of iTunes is that you can select the option of using a shopping cart to gather your selections rather than having to buy now.  This is done by selecting Edit from the iTunes menu, selecting Preferences and then selecting Store.  Since this is run on their internet server you would think your list would be safe.  But it isn't. Not only can your library on your own computer become corrupted, but if you put items into your iTunes shopping cart some software bug or database issue on the iTunes server can destroy the list of items you were intending to buy.  This happened to me this week.  Imagine spending hours sorting through songs and putting them in your cart.  And then later you go back to buy the items and they are gone.  Then you contact iTunes and tell them and they respond by telling you they have solved your problem of not being able to see the items in your cart by clearing your cart and that now you will be able to see items that you add to your cart.  No, they couldn't tell you what you had in your cart before they cleared it.

But iTunes support then tells me, you could make a "wish list" as a playlist and then this wouldn't happen.  This meaning that you wouldn't be mad at iTunes for the fact that their server software or database has a problem.  But as I pointed out in the beginning, iTunes libraries get corrupted and that would also destroy your "wish list".

The unstable iTunes Shopping Cart issue was on the record as early as last fall and it is clear that iTunes could care less about solving that problem.  And similarly iTunes could care less about the fact that their software has some issue in it that allows individual's iTunes libraries to be corrupted.  If they cared these problems would have been fixed.

If you are considering buying a product that relies on iTunes you need to keep these things in mind.

I got my first 169time upgrade back in 2001 for a DTC100.  At first it could only do local HDTV so I also got the upgrade for my Integra satellite box.  Finally in summer 2002 169time shipped the AVX1 and I could record HBO HD and HDNET satellite.

Even with the funky name, these 169time guys are the super heroes of HDTV recording, supporting HD recording with my JVC deck and PC before there was any other way to do it.  They're still the only way to do satellite HD.  They even fixed my DTC100 for free and it wasn't even their product's fault.

Since then I've gotten my HDD200 4DTV decoder upgraded so I could get Starz HD on tape.  I also got a friend of mine in Canada to upgrade his Bell Express 6000 since he gets a bunch of the latest PPV movies in HD taped that I can't get here.

When I bought my new DLP HDTV I also paid $899 for the Sony Sat-HD300 with the DVI.  I just had the HD300 169time upgraded for firewire and it's fantastic.

I bought an HD-TIVO HR10-250 at a major chain store because the salesman said it had firewire and could record HD to my JVC.  When I got it home and opened the box I nearly threw it out the window I was so mad.  I took it back the same day and bought a Hughes HTL-HD for hundreds less than the Sony and it's the same exact box as my Sony except the front panel.  If you're going to buy a DirecTV box for recording, the HTL-HD is the best deal today.  Add the 169time upgrade to it and you'll be the envy for sure.

For the size of these speakers, they certainly do put out a good bit of sound. While they sound may get lost in an overly noisy room, it works great in places like offices and homes. The one down side is that this product is made for the older iPods, so while it works on the Video iPod; it doesn't sit perfectly centered.

I ride my bike along a mountain road and cannot use earphones with my ipod for obvious security reasons but I still wanted my music with me and this tiny speaker worked perfect for me.  The road has little car traffic so most of my ride is very peaceful and quite and I can hear the music loud enough.  It's not even necessary to use the highest volume level in my ipod, and I don't recommend it either because the quality of the sound will diminish.  This is just what I needed for my bike:  small enough to take along and loud enough to enjoy my music.  Maybe adding the word "personal" to this speaker will be useful for buyers to understand that this speaker is intended for one person and will not work on large, loud, open spaces with a lot of people around.  One of its best features is that it is not loud enough to bother anybody.  Not everyone wants to listen to your music anyway

I saw this while browsing and knew that I had to get it. I've been wanting to get a speaker like this ever since I saw somebody on a train with one. 

In many areas, the podwave is outstanding. It is absolutely miniscule, about the size of 1 and 1/2 C batteries, and can easily be carried around. The sound is clear and piercing, with loud songs necessitating the turning down of the volume. It also looks good, even though I have a black iPod Nano, I didn't find it awkward looking at all.

There are however some bad things. When in a moderately loud environment, one has to lean down closer to the speaker in order to hear. The speaker only has an on/off switch, not any volume control, so the maximum setting on your MP3 player is what you get. There is also very little bass. 

However, there are some tricks that make using it a lot easier and more enjoyable. Put the speaker over the opening to a tissue box in order to get louder, richer, deeper sound. If there isn't a tissue box handy, hold the podwave to your throat in order to get the best sound

I wouldn't recommend these speakers for your next house party. But these little speakers are perfect to lay on your desktop while you work on your computer at home. And at work, they won't disturb your co-workers and are easily hidden from the boss. Also, the Podwave doesn't need much power at all. I use a "dead" AA battery from my digital camera. It's a good way to "finish off" all my old AA batteries.

Unless you are Superman and have super hearing or possiblity strap your iPod to your head, the sound is so minimal it is almost impossible to hear it.  The idea was great and the quality of the unit itself appears quite good, but it is USELESS!  Save your money and invest in the Altec Lansing Portable Speakers - beautifully made, great carry case included and the sound is terrific

Outside of ear buds, this is as nano-sized as you can go for amplified sound from an iPod.  With my 1st-generation, regular-sized iPod, the Macally Podwave does the trick--at least in the office, bedroom, or lakeside cabin. The sound has presence, the volume is adequate, there's just enough bass to let me catch the bass player's walking lines and solos.  As a musician, I require musical "content," not some sort of virtual audio reality.  Consequently, I may be easier to please than some listeners.

There are a few caveats:

1.  If you have the most recent iPod, with the off-center input, forget this item.  It would look ridiculous on a new (especially black-colored) iPod.
2.  If you plan to take it outside on walks, picnics, etc., you'll be disappointed unless you live in a quiet neighborhood and use the speaker during the early morning or late evening hours.
3.  I had planned to use the item with the iPod in my shirt pocket.  Most of my pockets are either too narrow to accommodate the speaker or too deep to prevent gravity from separating the iPod from the speaker.
4.  There's no light on the on-off switch to remind you to turn it off.  If left on, the battery wears down in a day or two, as evidenced by distorted, intermittent sound.

Bottom line: Nothing miraculous, maybe a trifle overpriced, but effective within reason and one of a kind

I like to use this for times when I do not want headphones on but need to be moving around. Works great for it's small size. Battery is AA and last. Easy to replace with rechargeable battery. Do not buy for large area. Anyone who complains probably wanted them to serve as a boombox. Not powerful but perfect for running around with. I have not seen any other options in this size range. Seems a little expensive for size. I've had this for over a year and no problems! As a side note: You can add a cord and use with computer.

This remote will allow you to replace most of your remotes, at least most of the time.  The code system to initially program it works for most devices and the code search will probably work with all the others.  There are 2 screens to handle all operations but that is not a big deal.  The only problem is if there is not a button for one of the functions on your old remote you can not add it.  The learning feature allows you to program a button using the old remote but remembering that you changed the input button to do something else is not the best solution and if there just aren't enough buttons on the 2 screens you can't add one.  That said for the price this is a great remote that will handle almost everything you need

Having owned a previous, unreliable RCA remote I was intrigued by the context sensitive, touch screen capabilities of this one.  First off, this remote seems to have nixed the problems of the previous RCA remote I owned (now discarded).  This unit also has the ability to retain its programming during battery changes!  I was wondering when someone was going to figure that one out.  The remote itself is pretty straightforward to use.  Although the touch screen requires several pages for some functions.  For instance, the DirectTV satellite "guide" button is on the 2nd screen yet the "info" key is on the first screen.  You'd thought someone would've put the two buttons on the same screen but alas they did not.  So you will touch, touch and touch a few more times to do what you did in a couple of button pushes on your DirectTV remote.  However, does that diminish the quality of this remote?  Nope.  I don't mind a couple of extra button pushes for the much easier to use interface and stability that my wife enjoys using.  Gone are the days of her complaining about my 5 separate remotes (or the one not-so-stable remote).   This remote also has the ability to control our AIWA muli-national VCR that supports PAL and SECAM modes.  Is it the final solution?  Probably not.  Hopefully in a couple more iterations RCA will have it right however until that happens this is a wonderful remote

This receiver makes my Paradigm Titans sound like $2000 speakers!  In order to benefit from the pure digital technology in this amp, you need to feed it digital, however.  

Believe the other reviews when they say that out of the box, this amp sounds like garbage.  An analog input, and default settings will yield mediocrity.

I was feeding the receiver with a 30' analog input from my iMac.  The bass was thick and muddy and the highs had no vibrance to them.  Once I got a toslink optical cable, it revealed the amp's potential.  

My amp came with the speaker size set to "small" which removed anything below 100hz from the output.  This made the music sound tinny and empty.   Change speaker size to large to fix this.

Now, this amp is audiophile material.  But the remote was designed by morons.  You can't adjust the bass, treble, balance or fade with the remote.  It's basically useful for changing input, volume, dolby settings and power.  How can such simple features be overlooked.

Worth $3000 and five stars if it wasn't for the remote.  If you can snag it below $200, it's worth it.

I stumbled across this receiver when looking to replace a dying 14 year old Sony receiver.  The reviews here and elsewhere convinced me.  Don't be fooled by the price!  This amp throws out amazing, clean power to rival analog amps costing hundreds and hundreds more.  Hooked up to my Klipsch KG 4.2 speakers, I can crank any genre of music and am blown away by the fine details I never heard before, and the bass never gets muddy.

Buy this receiver now and crank it up

I bought this receiver a couple of weeks ago and it's been working great so far. However, I realized that it can only be used with an active subwoofer and I did not have one. I am here to ask your opinion on a reasonably good sub woofer system that works with this receiver. Thanks in advance for your answer

I bought this off Amazon when it was on sale for $150. Shipping was pretty quick.

I've used a fair amount of receivers from vintage gear to receivers from a year or two ago. This one blows all of the ones I've used out of the water.

Setting up the receiver was a breeze. I hooked it up to my Digital Skyline speakers in bi-amp mode. I am truly impressed with the clarity of the sound with this receiver. Bass is very precise and I can hear nice, rich sound from my music collection. It's also pretty easy to use.

The only gripe I have is the remote. It's fine ot have a universal, but I have several universal remotes and they all don't share the same functions.

The receiver looks good and when I'm ready to get into surround sound the panny will be ready. 

Bottom line: I would've easily paid more for this receiver and even at $200 it's a steal

There are an adequate number of reviews for this product, so I will only comment on my great experience with Amazon.  

About a week after purchase (and minimal use) the receiver started to squeal.  It continued to get louder until I feared putrid dielectric smoke was going to pour out the top.  Although it was slightly past the return period, Amazon took the item back and replaced it at no cost to me, with no questions asked.

The second receiver has been used for nearly a year with no problems.  I am very happy with my purchase.  
Thanks Amazon

this item has killed my ipod twice. the first time i wasnt sure if it was just a faulty ipod so i had it replaced because it was still under apple's 1 year warrenty, but this time it is no longer covered. i am now filing a claim with belkin and they may be replacing it, but seriously, why even risk this?

i wish i never bought this.

If You are thinking of buying a Belkin Product DON'T.  There products are hard to find, and you will get conflicting information from their vendors.  This is what happened to me. I was told to order this product by a salesperson at Circuit City.  I went to Bestbuy, Radio Shack and then Circuit City to find it.  None of these stores had the product available.  I was told at Circuit City that this product would solve my problem by allowing me to charge my Belkin wireless FM Receiver which I purchased for Christmas for my Daughter from Costco.  The product didn't solve the problem.  I still have to buy batteries for the Belkin Wireless FM Receiver.  Which by the way uses quite a lot of them.  After all the time I spent trying to fix this Belkin Product I purchased a Sony Product online that was cheaper, easier to get and did the job better than any Belkin Product

The unit worked very well for a while, but, one day, I plugged it in and the iPod just went dead. It did not register in the computer, and would not play any music. I returned the iPod to the Apple store, and they gave me a new one. But, a few months later, the exact same thing happened again! This time, however, I'm beyond the 1-year warranty, and do not think Apple will help me out again. 

Beware of this product! Don't trust your expensive music player to a cheap power cord - buy a different brand and save yourself a headache

I was a little skeptical of these speakers being able to create dynamic sound for their reasonable price.  When I installed these I was blown away.  They bring out the mid and low range with no flaws.  These speakers were made to be played loud.  For anyone who is intrested in investing a reasonable amount of money on great speakers this is the way to go

I needed a pair of floorstanding speakers for my home theater system and bought these after reading a lot of good reviews online.  However they turned out to be a real disappointment.  The sound was harsh, boomy and too sharp.  I decided to remove the speaker units to check, thinking that perhaps there might be loose connections inside.  What a shock I got when I saw what was inside: The woofers have real tiny magnets and there was no crossovers used on them, there are working as full-range speakers, the reason for the harsh sounds since they are producing the whole range of frequencies...they should not be called "woofers".  Then the midrange speaker and the tweeter.  The midrange unit has a 2.7uf capacitor and the tweeter has a 1.2uf capacitor as "crossover".  That means the crossover frequency for the midrange is around 7,350Hz and for the tweeter,  around 16,500Hz!!!!  These are figures one can calculate on line.  These are real cheap speakers with really poor quality sound.  I am disgusted to have purchased them.  One would expect better from Sony.  Sony should changed the advertisment for them, especially the part about the crossover and the woofers.  They only good point is they look nice.  If there is a rating lower than 1 Star, I woulD have used it

The built is elegant, the 3-way configuration provides a balanced and wide frequency response (although sometimes a bit too heavy on the bass), and the system's low end response makes the use of most compact subwoofers unnecessary.  This is one pair of Sony speakers (next to the SS-MF750H with dual 8" Kevlar bass drivers) any home cinema enthusiast should sample when shopping for a pair of main / surround speakers.

Best used with cosmetically and sonically matching SS-CR550H center / surround speaker package (which by the way cost more than a pair of SS-MF650H) for a decent 5.1 home theatre, but substituting the tiny surround speakers with another pair of the MF650H will deliver a more convincing surround sound. Being sold in pairs makes the SS-MF650H very affordable for a 7.1 set up, although substantial floor space will be required.

Each pair of speakers come in a single large cardboard package that weighs in at around 28kg, so it would be a good idea to have them delivered to your front door. 

Please note that the MF650H does not support bi-amp wiring and the height of the tweeter is only around 90cm from the floor. When used with a giant screen (over 42"), it may be a good idea to have the speakers slightly elevated (although not too much). 

Purchase Price : USD 15

I wasn't expecting much from these speakers. I guess I'm old school and used to think you needed to spend $1000/pr for speakers with decent sound quality.

I picked up a  pair of these on sale for a back room in my house. I didn't expect much but the price was right and they would serve the purpose of providing front channel sound to a small stereo unit in what serves as my den.

When I powered these from an older 22w/ch system that I bought overseas in the Navy I thought I was hearing things.

They delivered smooth full bass with balances midrange and highs you will not believe. They are not boomy but smooth and mellow all the way down to where a subwoofer would take over.
I couldn't believe I got that sound from such inexpensive speakers. 

I used to be a chauvenist about Sony and for that matter most Japanese speakers ( or these days Chinese speakers) and would never consider them for any serious use but I was pleasantly surprised by these.

They will never replace my BA's or Infiniti's for my main system, but darn these are good for the money.

Sony has done their homework, and engineered a wonderful loudspeaker that sells at a great price. I suspect most people would be quite pleased with these as main music or front surround speakers for low to modest powered amplifiers or receivers.

I gave then 5 stars since they have such value for the money. In terms of absolute sound quality I would give them a 3.5 - 4, but the value component raised them an additional star. 

They could never serve in every situation, and my 1200 w/ch bridged  M500T Carvers would blow them to pieces, but for my modest 22w/ch or most consumer grade equipment up to 120 w/c FTC I think these guys are quite good.

I was very impressed by these

I purchased this on impulse without researching brands when I was shopping for a small tv.

A very poor performer unless it will be used purely as a monitor

This tuner performs much better than the HD tuner that Timer Warner Cable had given me. I can get HD for free instead of paying $100+ bucks with cable, and TIme Warner really sucks, will never go back again.

 Just connected an antenna, and it was able to get almost all the channels which the Humax could receive, and clarity is very comparabe to Humax HFA.

 I disconnected my cable service and connected the STR to cable, and it was able to tune into all the un-encrypted HD content on cable. Just tuned lot more blank channels, but those can be manually deleted with some effort.

 Just one complaint: Don't know why nobody provides a clock on the front display, but that's okay.

 I am very pleased, and would highly recommend

I love having these tuners around.  They're essential for any HDTV that does not have an ATSC tuner built-in.  If you don't have an HD tuner, but you have an HDTV, you need one of these.  You get free HD broadcasts from all of the major networks (TV shows, movies, sports), and the bandwidth (and therefore quality) is supposedly wider (thus better) than satellite HD broadcasts.  There is a stunning difference in quality between standard definition television (SDTV) and high-definition television (HDTV) broadcasts, even if you are getting your signal from a digital source, such as cable or satellite.

If you have an ordinary SDTV (standard definition, 480i), these tuners are still the best kept secret today.  (Are satellite and cable broadcasters keeping this quiet?)  You get fantastic signal quality on all of the TV stations you already receive, plus you get so many extra stations (free of charge!).  In my area, I get local weather and weather radar, even a station that plays nothing but music videos ("The Tube").  Also, the FCC is phasing out all NTSC (analog) broadcasts after February 17, 2009.  So, if you don't have an ATSC (digital) tuner, you won't be able to pick up over-the-air (OTA) broadcasts any more!

Most people don't know about these tuners, and most of the people who know about them think they are a lot more complicated than they really are.  Go to www.AntennaWeb.org to determine what stations broadcast in your area and from what direction they broadcast.  Then just point your antenna in the direction of the broadcast, and you'll probably get more channels than you expect.  A lot of people are trying to sell "HDTV antennas".  This is truly a crock.  The "HDTV" antennas are really just UHF antennas.  Most ATSC broadcasts are sent via UHF, but a few are sent via VHF.  So forget all of the fancy antennas, definitely forget the amplified antennas (they amplify noise as much as the signal you want), and just hook up your old bunny ears.  If you really live far away from the broadcast, you may need a bigger roof-mount or outdoor antenna.  If you're in a city, and you don't have excessive obstruction (in a valley, lots of buildings or trees) you probably can get most, if not all, of the stations broadcast in your area.

I recently purchased an LCD TV that has a built-in tuner; so, I now have this connected to a standard definition TV.  It's still great, even when connected to an SDTV.  This tuner locks into weak signals quite well (so does the Humax).  The ATSC tuner built into my new LCD TV does not pick up the weak channels as well as this box.  This box does not have as nice of a program guide (just like your satellite or cable service) as the Humax tuner; however, the Humax tuner will freeze-up sometimes, requiring you to unplug and plug it back in.  There are many options for connection on both boxes, the main difference being that the Samsung has DVI out, whereas the Humax has HDMI out.  If you have an HDTV with HDMI in, but no ATSC tuner, you're probably better off with the Humax

Will keep it short, since other  reviews cover all the super picture quality from this box.
Pros:
(1)Crystal clear picture quality. (I use a regular TV monitor for displaying)
(2)Easy to setup
(3)Excellent price 
Cons:
(1) Channel change time slightly slow but not annoying
Other things to note:
(1) On your TV remote, use the "Input" button to set your TV to "Video". I didn't do this initially and it took me some playing around to figure it out.
(2)Pointing the antenna towards the TV station doesn't always give you the strongest signal. It depends on whether the antenna is outdoor, indoor, multipath, building material (wood, brick..). Though ,my TV stations are at 7 degrees (measured clockwise from North), I obtained the strongest signal at about 120 degrees, by pointing the antenna at my window rather than at 7 degrees (stone wall). So play around with your antenna direction when setting it up.

I bought the device and first could not get any signal. In fact, after returning the device, the replacement did the same until I found out that the channel numbers and those listed are actually not identical. After letting the system search for channels, it worked. It still requires a well set antenna to get all channels you were used to without drops of frames, but when the antenna is right it is really working well.
I have the device connected via video and audio input to my old Philips Magnavox TV and get good quality images of a sharpness and color clarity I never experienced before.
 
Some settings need to be remembered: 
1) the conventional 4:3 TV format needs to be set
2) the switch on the back needs to to be set to analog output if used with a conventional TV
3) Reduce antenna cable length to a minimum
4) let the device search for channels, after optimizing antenna repeat search.

I would recommend the system. After all, when all comes in HD, I will replace my TV by a HD monitor and I'm done

I bought this item through Amazon. It arrived 3 days later, in perfect shape. I've connected it to my 40 inches Sony Bravia HDTV ready TV, with a very ship an efecctive RCA indoor antenna (costs 7 dollars in Target) and: voil�, now I am able to enjoy the beauty of HDTV. The set up is easy, the quality seems great. I have it here in Mexico for about a month and no problems so far. Highly reccomended

Wasn't sure what to expect when hooking up the tuner to our existing outdoor antenna since some stores/web sites advise installing an HDTV antenna and some friends told me that was B.S.  Anyways,  I was able to pull in all the digital channels in my area without problems.  The only two hitches I encountered are...

1) I thought I would be able to connect the antenna and start flipping through channels immediately.  However, since that didn't work, I had to read the manual that told me I had to add the channels first.

2) I tried all the suggested codes they had, but I cannot get the Samsung remote to work w/ my Toshiba TV.  So, on/off and volume via Toshiba remote.  Channel selection via Samsung remote.  Yes, a bit of a hassle with cost this box 1 star

The Sharp LC-37D90U is the best HDTV on the planet (as far as I know). I narrowed my selection down to the 37D40U and the 90U, and it was tough to decide. Go for the 90U; the native 1080 resolution is well worth the extra $$$. NFL games on Fox 1080i and DVDs are immaculate on this TV.

Once you buy this set, you will need HD digital cable or satellite service, and you really need to go HDMI to see what this set is capable of. Get yourself a Logitech Harmony remote and an Oppo up-converting DVD player, and you will have a perfect setup for your viewing enjoyment.

After months and months of research and second thoughts, my wife and I finally decided on this television.  In short, it couldn't have been a better decision.  While I thought long and hard about the 42" Panasonic plasma, the stellar reviews on this (e.g., Consumer Reports and CNet) convinced me to look closer at this Sharp.  When I saw it in a local store I was sold (though of course Amazon offers a much better price).  The HD channels look *incredible* and even the standard definition shows look wonderful.  And my Xbox 360 looks absolutely brilliant.  And the fact that it supports 1080p gives me comfort that it will be much more "future proof" than most other TV sets currently being sold.  Highly recommended

This TV marks my entrance into the HD era and WOW; this TV is amazing and at a great price. HD looks incredible, great black levels once everything is adjusted, colors have real snap to them with the four wavelength backlight. Standard definition looks better than my previous 27" sony wega CRT, which is a high compliment for a hidef TV. Tonnes of menu options and user configurable picture settings for each input. I've had no trouble with viewing angle or back light bleed as reviewers on other sites have mentioned (I think those problems were associated with the first production run). And yes this TV accepts a 1080p input through component video (verified on avs forums). Video games look amazing, at least gamecube, ps2, and dreamcast, it goes without saying an xbox360 or ps3 would be mindblowing.

After about a month of research I chose the Sharp set over sony's 32/40xbr1 and other comparable LCD's because 37" is the perfect size if you don't want your TV overshadowing your living room. Also it has 1080p resolution and better color decoding than most other sets.  

I would mark five stars but I think one component input is a bit skimpy, not a problem if you have a reciever with component inputs. Also there seems to be some minor timing issues between the chrominance and luminance through the DVI connection with a PC, which may be fixable through the service menu

You might be interested to know the exact width is 36&9/16".  The picture is bright even at mid backlight and brightness settings.  I am more than pleased with its black levels and white contrast.  It also has minimal loss in picture quality at extreme viewing angles.  Glare from my room light is not as noticeable on this set as it was on my last TV.   This TV has a very good upconverter.  I supply it 480i, 720p, & 1080i through its HDMI input and even the 480i looks better than it did on my old 32" Samsung CRT TV.   I actually prefer to watch 480i content on a non-HD station because the TV upconverts it to fill the screen whereas 480i content on an HD station is usually broadcast in 720p with side bars to maintain the 4:3 aspect which doesn't look good to me.  The 720p and 1080i content look amazing.  480p from my DVD through the component (RGB) video connection also looks great.  One negative I have may not be related to this set at all, but I'm not sure so I'll mention it... when I'm tuned to Discovery HD Theater, sometimes the camera panning action across a wide-angle view is jerky rather than smooth.  

Finally, the remote is nothing special.  It controls the TV necessities.  I use a Logitech Harmony remote and was pleased to find the instruction set included commands not available on the original remote; specifically regarding switching inputs.  The original remote requires to you select the input with one button, but the TV will accept individual commands for directly tuning to a specific input.

I got my 37D90U yesterday, it came out of the Box, and blew my mind, this thing look amazing, very money !!.
So I got it all hooked up, it's a bit dizzying with the manual, and all the menus, and set up choices, but after 2 hours, I think I got it down pretty good, to make the picture look good. I have Digital cable, and hooking the TV up to it, really looks like [...], I have the picture looking as well as I can but I had to order HD cable, and hopefully it will make a bit difference in the TV viewing.

On to Movies, I just bought a Oppo DV-970HD DVD player, Amazing for the price, with an HDMI cable included, Connected to the TV via the HDMI and with 1080, My DVD's Looked amazing, It was what I was hopping for in a HDTV, and I'm still considering getting it professionally calibrated. So now I got to live with this thing for a few, and watch some action stuff and see how it deals with that. I got a pretty good deal on the price, a bit expensive, but the 37 inch is perfect, and doesn't look like it takes over the living room. Get a extended warranty with it, just to protect yourself, ya never know what kind of [...] can happen to these things. Till next time.

We own a Bed & Breakfast and we needed an inexpensive compact DVD player to move around to connect to TVs in our guest rooms when required to play DVDs. After lots of looking I chose the Coby DVD-224 and it meets the need very well.  It has all the features needed, a good remote and it works well.  In fact this review is following the purchase of our 2nd one, and we will probably buy more.   We use these units only occasionally so I can't comment on long term durability.  Based on our needs and use I can certainly recommend the unit. For $30 it is hard to go wrong

I purchased this DVD player because I had read on a 'tech' website that it could be adjusted to play European DVDs.  I had been looking for a DVD player that would allow me to play DVDs I had purchased in Europe.  Most were pretty expensive.
Setting this one up to play the European DVDs required following instructions from the 'tech' website but was not too complicated.  It's not the greatest DVD player but works great for the purpose for which I purchased it

Good inexpensive player, played all types of media I threw at it. It can be set up to a specific zone to play imported DVDs. This was an important factor for me, google for instructions. It is pretty compact, about the size of a large hardcover book. It feels a little bit cheap, so I am not sure about its long-time reliability. Still pretty good for the price, though

I've been using my Recoton for over five years to power my Braun electric toothbrush in Europe. Perhaps the only problem with the Recoton is the plug. As the converter is so heavy it does not always stay attached to well to the wall/outlet. I use mine in multi-plug strip that sits on the floor, so I don't have to worry about the converter falling out. If you plan on staying in one place for an extended period of time (i.e. not using the converter while traveling), I would suggest the Franzus 85 Watt available on Amazon. It's heavier and bulkier than the Recoton, but it's grounded and accepts US grounded plugs AND uses the Shhuka-style (grounded and recessed, holding the converter nicely in the wall) plug found in much of Europe.

I used this device, and it works well as advertised with some notes:
1. It is heavy, as said before, but given that it has two modes of operation, its weight is justified.
2. Using a battery charger that doesn't drain much power with it, the converter became hot causing the charger adaptor to become hot as well. This is by plugging the converter for about 4 hours!
3. The modes of operation are do NOT provide continuous wattage coverage meaning that:
  * First mode is: 0 - 50W (from zero to fifty)
  * Second mode  : 500 - 1600w (from five-hundreds to one thousand and six hundreds)
  This means that the area from 50-500W is not supported by the device!
4. The device is fused

I have moved to Lithuania for 1 1/2 years and brought this along with me.  I have some small appliances (sleep sound machine, toothbrush charger, battery charger, rice cooker) that I brought with me and needed the power conversion.  I brought two of these converters with me and have been using them successfully for the past 9 months.  

There are some comments about how it's heavy and may have a hard time staying in the electrical outlet.  They are a little heavy, but I've never had to prop mine up to make them work.  Even if it is leaning over a little, it works just fine.

I bought it  right before my trip to London, UK, and it was fine the first evening. But the next night I was trying to charge my Palm and use my laptop, it overheated while set at 50W (not 1600W) for no reason and blew up the Palm charger. I had to buy a new charger upon return.

I hope this particular unit was a lemon, but I am returning it and looking for another product to replace it.

This was my first attempt to crimp CAT5/6 ethernet for home networking.  I bought a spool of CAT5 and ends from Home Depot and bought this tool online.  I had absolutely no problem with this tool.  It worked perfectly every time.  I only needed it for a short time, but it seemed nice and sturdy.  

By the way, don't forget to look up color diagrams and make sure you use the correct twisted pairs together.  It isn't enough to just have the right stright-through connections from one end to another.  You must match the correct pairs.  Although color doesn't matter, you have to pair the expected two at the other end.  That's how it does error correction, by assuming the same interference is seen on each twisted pair and cancels out the same signal on both.  If you don't pair them correctly, it cannot error correct.  I needed a 50 foot run under the house, and it didn't work until I paired the correct twisted pair.  Do some internet research on this and print some colored guides

We've had this phone for about a month & when we first got it, the handset would ring at the same time as the base.  But lately I've noticed that the handset doesnt ring/make a sound until about 1 second after the base.  Another reviewer said the same thing for the 9485/2 and it's annoying.  When this happens the handset is no more than 30ft from the base, so I know it's not a distance thing.  Another thing is that the date/time/name "stays on" on the handset - which is a waste.  The melodies/tones are "cheesy" like a lot of other reviewers have stated.
Apart from that this phone is pretty cool.  The monitor is a cool feature.  Make sure to press "privacy" though if you dont want someone listening in on your conversation.  U can also record your calls and another cool feature is when someone else calls while you're on the phone - U have the option to send them str8 to the voicemail, or send them a message saying to hold on or u can send a message saying you're busy.
Will purchase additional handsets in the future

Good sound quality and user friendly interface/setup. 

The things that stand out most for me are: 

-Large buttons on the base, HS buttons aren't too small.
-Speaker phone on both the base and HS.
-Adjustable volume on the fly(6 settings)for ear and speaker     phone.
-Easy to read displays.
-HS is just the right size, not too big, not too small.
-All in one phone, caller ID, and answering machine.
-Flashing light indicating new message.

If I have any beef at all at this point it's that the caller ID memory on the base doesn't update when you delete a number from the HS. Besides that, I am very pleased with the whole package.

I would easily recommend this product to my family and friends.

Superb, extensible 5.8 GHz cordless phone system

The introduction of 2.4GHz-based 802.11b/g wireless computer networks will spell the end of many 2.4GHz-based cordless phone systems. Though one can continue to use the phones, the interference they cause with wireless computer networks is a nagging problem. The solution is to either upgrade your cordless phones or your wireless computer network to 5.8GHz. For most, upgrading the phone will be simpler and cheaper than upgrading the network.

But selecting a new cordless phone is no simple proposition. There are dozens of variables to consider, and a wide range of brands, models and prices. Rather than searching primarily by price, many will find it easier to search by the specifics of their functional needs, narrow the results by reviews and brand reputation, and then narrow further by price.

My search began with these technical requirements:

�	5.8GHz in both directions (some manufacturers extend handset battery by using 5.8Ghz base-to-handset, and 2.4GHz handset-to-base).
�	Digital handset-to-base transmission, and with some form of frequency-hopping spread spectrum technology for security.
�	System extendable to at least three cordless handsets.
�	Handsets must include headphone jack and speakerphone.
�	Base unit must include digital answering machine.
�	Excellent audio (listening and speaking from handset and headphone jacks.
�	Useable audio (listening and speaking) from speakerphone.
�	Ergonomic handset with positive-touch buttons of reasonable size.

I'm particularly uninterested in cordless phones that attempt to mimic the size, weight and ergonomics of cellular handsets. I do not carry my cordless phone in my pocket, and I have no need to trade ergonomics for portability.

Items that do not concern me include:

�	Caller ID.
�	Phone book.
�	Cordless range longer than 25-feet.

With that, I researched dozens of products that met some or all of my basic criteria, including models from Motorola, AT&T, Uniden, Panasonic, VTech and several others.  All but the Uniden TRU9485 (which is available in the base single-handset package, as well as 2- and 3-handset packages) failed one or more criteria -- typically ergonomics.  The TCX905 handset (supplied with the TRU9485 system) could still use slightly larger number buttons, but compared to all the other models I inspected in person, it was the easiest to dial.

The TRU9485 has all the basics I listed above, plus many extras that are very handy:

�	Two handsets can participate in a call simultaneously.
�	Room/baby monitoring that allows any handset to monitor any other handset.
�	Handset-to-handset communication, either as an intercom, or directly without engaging the base.
�	System time and date set from any handset.
�	Single touch "do not disturb" button on base unit silences all ringers.
�	Phonebook entries can be sent from any station to any other station.
�	Remote answering machine control from any handset.
�	3 number redial list.
�	100 number caller ID list.
�	Separate mute and hold functions.
�	Detailed, easy-to-follow instructions.

And lots more. The system is compatible with a number of Uniden handsets, including TCX805, TCX400, TCX440, TWX977, ELX 500) and the TCX905 included with base. Everything you need is included, including batteries, belt clips, and even a phone line for the base unit.

The TX905 handset has a nice weight, and the buttons have a positive feel that lets you know when they've been pressed. The display is easy to read, and the internalized antenna is a plus.

There are very few things I dislike about this system, all of which are drawbacks with nearly every cordless system out there:

�	Limited ring tones/tunes.
�	Only three ring volume levels (off, low, high).
�	Short answering machine record time (12 minutes).
�	Answering machine security code is only 2 digits.
�	Always-on lights on handset base units waste power.

Overall this system is a terrific improvement over the 2.4 GHz system that it replaced, and other than the typical cheesy, electronic ringtones, there's really no major improvements I could think of. [�2006 redtunictroll at hotmail dot com

Remember those first pentium/pentium II computers in the mid-late 90s had 4 gig hard drives on the entire computer? This memory card is smaller than a stamp and thinner than a penny and holds 4,000,000,000 bytes (or 4,000 megabytes)of info! Pretty amazing for something so small. At a hundred and twenty bucks its a great value. Can hold lots of videos/movies/music. Wonder what 2020 will be like with memory cards

Been going back and forth with the Sling customer support team for six weeks now and so far haven't been able to get the device to work at all on my home network. 

In fairness to Sling, my home network is fairly complex with a combination of wired and wireless devices. Still, even when directly plugged into my router with my PC, the Sling software cannot even discover the player.

In the meantime, they've come out with a more sophisticated player, but I'm most likely not going to take a chance on it.

I would have rated a 5 but HO3 code came up today after 2 years of service. I read all of these reviews. As was suggested I took the back off (very carefully I might add because strap wires hold 2 units together.) and turned the worm screw with my finger to move the lens to the middle of it's track. I found a small hair or fiber wrapped around the worm screw. I pulled the fiber off and unit now works fine. Took longer to type this then to fix. Hope this helps others

Mine lasted for about 18 months before H03 reared its head.  Took it to my local customer 'service' center where it was examined by a man who apparently knew nothing about this error code, or indeed the player, at all.  Best he could offer was some comment about 18 months being the average life for such a product.  Outrageous!  And, then waffled on about there being no power coming from the battery, which is clearly untrue before finishing up with some useful advice about buying a new one.  It was at this point I picked up my 'dead' player and left.  I'll be trying the tips on this page but if I do have to buy a new player it certainly won't be from Panasonic.  Oh, and their wireless 'surround' headphones are useless as well

I bought this little guy two years ago, and for as often as I use it, it has held up well. Further more, the battery time is great! I have got 8 hours from it each time I have fully charged it. I bought a regular DVD player from Toshiba and a year later it burnt out. I have been using this little thing as a replacement DVD player until I can find something in a standard size that will work as well as this one has

I purchased this unit in 2004 and I received the HO3 error and the unit does not work any longer. I called Panasonic and was told the 90 days warranty is up and I would have to pay for the repairs and labor!!! I told them to go on line and there are 100's of complaints about this unit H03 error.
The Panasonic technical support person said the H03 error comes up depending upon the "USAGE." So, I said to her if I used it TOO much after the 90 days I would have to pay to get it repaired. She said  "yes.' So, if you purchase this unit don't use it because you will get the H03 error and it will no longer be playable. There is "NO" recall on this unit. Buyer beware!!!!

This player has been great for us for about 14 months. Tonight we ran into the infamous H03, but had it up and running again after reading the trouble-shooting ideas below. 

The initialization trick (back skip/play/pause simultaneously) did not work, but taking the bottom off of the player and fiddling with the transport mechanism did the trick. For details, see "Jedi"'s review below (approx. 40 reviews from the end). It is not a difficult exercise, so do not be intimidated by taking the screws out and getting your fingers in there. You will need a jeweler's philips-head screwdriver (the tiny, long ones).

As many have said, the unit is sturdy, easy to operate, and has an attractive screen. Clearly, Panasonic is looking the other way on this one, or we'd have heard of a recall by now

Got this error on my Panasonic Portable DVD and did a google search to see what came up... found all these reviews. Very helpful, thanks folks! The trick with the back skip, pause and play buttons (three or four reviews below) works a treat (at least for now!). Certainly beats a call to Panasonic who sound less than helpful judging by previous reviews. Fingers crossed..

I have had this unit for just under 1 year and have just fixed the "HO3 Error" for the 2nd time. I decided to call the company and was told a variety of things, from "yes I know what this code means" to Panasonic does not recognize this error code. They want me to send the unit to them and charge me half of the labor charge. When I explained that this seems to be a common problem the guy got rude. I then promised him to never buy a Pansasonic product again. 
I fixed it after the call and it works for now. I unscrewed the bottom and there was a bit of dust in the mechanism.
One of the reps from Panasonic said that to be sure to not just cut the power to the player when done, but to push stop and then
off, to shut it down properly. I will try and see if that makes a difference.

I just got the dreaded H03 error, and I see I am not alone.  Seems like Panasonic planted a time bomb so we would have to buy a new one after a period of time.  This should be a recall, not a warranty issue (short warranty by the way). Sleazy, my last panasonic purchase.

Otherwise, this was a good player, a little small by today's standards

After doing some searching online I found the following solution on a message forum:  

Open up the bottom cover by taking out the screws - 10 or so. This will reveal the lens and motor module. Flip over the model and you should see the gear and shaft for the lens. Move the gear so that the lens move towards the center. Click the covers back into place , reconnect the battery and try. There were many responses that said it was easy and the unit works perfectly.

Another person said to do the following: 

Error codes could be solved by turning on your device, taking out any disk, closing the tray and pushing the back skip, pause, and play buttons at the same time. Hold for about 4 seconds and the screen will go blank then "initializing" will appear and your player will read your disks again.

I want to buy this unit but I'm hesitant.  I'd love to hear if this works.  Good luc

Originally purchased this mouse for laptop use, but it immediately became my favorite mouse ever -- even for desktop use. Now I have Stowaways for all computers used on a routine basis.

Don't let the small size fool you into thinking of the Stowaway as a poor portable substitute for a real mouse. The many positive synergies designed into this small, lightweight cordless optical mouse make it a joy for general use:

  [] Optical sensor lets you mouse on any surface with a bit of texture -- e.g., your thigh, or a good friend's thigh.
  [] Remote cordless operation makes many things possible -- e.g., control presentations out of your laptop from a podium 30 feet away.
  [] Small size encourages mousing with only your fingertips (instead of your whole hand � wrist, elbow or shoulder, as larger, heavier mice either invite or require). At that point, you're pointing only those muscles best suited to fine motor control and eye coordination.
  [] Finer control allows shorter throws to cross the entire screen. Once you've bumped up your pointer speed and acceleration settings to take full advantage, you'll find yourself able to...
  [] Mouse comfortably and accurately in =much= smaller areas -- e.g., on the handrest of a laptop keyboard deck, or even between those coalescing piles of junk on your desk. But even if you have all the room in the world...
  [] Shorter mouse excursions are better because they're ergonomcially safer for your wrist and less fatiguing in general.

Among many other endearing qualities, the Stowaway also

  [] Works with the standard Bluetooth HID drivers built into WinXP and Win2000 (sorry, don't know about Macs) and pairs readily any standard Bluetooth device offering standard HID services -- nothing proprietary involved.
  [] Fits comfortably in a shirt or pant pocket.
  [] Has a very pleasing matte texture and positive controls.
  [] Runs on 2 AAAs: Rechargeable NiMH AAAs deliver plenty of range and days to weeks of runtime between charges. They're also lighter than alkalines and far more wallet- and environment-friendly. With a pair of even lighter disposable lithium AAAs along for reliable emergency backup (~15-year shelf life), you really have nothing to lose with rechargeables -- unless you happen to enjoy enriching battery companies. My 2 year-old manuals didn't list NiMH rechargeables as a power option, but  don't let that stop you.
  [] Provides an on-off switch, thank God: A Bluetooth mouse without an on-off switch can run through batteries of any type in under a day -- especially when its buttons can be activated inadvertently, or when its paired devices are off or out of range. (Learned that one the hard way.)
  [] Provides a reconnect button: All paired Bluetooth devices lose track of one another now and then. (Alien interference, terrorist jamming, sun spots-- who knows?) Anyway, this button forces the mouse to send a reconnect signal when needed.

Enough. Try it -- you'll like it

The Think Outside Bluetooth Stowaway Travel Keyboard & Mouse arrived the day before I had to go to a meeting in Palm Springs. By the time I got to the meeting I was up and running with both. They worked flawlessly, although the learning curve is a bit steep at times with the keyboard. No problems at all with the mouse. Not having a number row on the keyboard keeps its footprint small, but adds a couple of function keys; that takes some to to adjust. That said, I felt completely at ease leaving my laptop at home; this combo makes my Axim x51v a real workhorse in meetings. 
P.S. I still haven't drained the batteries

I bought this mouse two month ago and I love it.  First the install on Macintosh (iBook) was very easy.  The mouse is precise and as not delay on movements.  The battery life is okay, but like any wireless device I will recommend to invest in rechargeable batteries.  I used this mouse all day long and I would just bring your attention that this is a traveling mouse so the ergonomic could be a little small for a all day use.  Although that is exactly what I do because I love it so much.  Highly recommended bluetooth mouse

This is a great BlueTooth Mouse.  It works very well with my Ipaq 2755.  I have the same companies keyboard which also works well, but the lay out of the keys is sometimes a pain in the @$$ because the function keys are required to be held down for numeric characters 1234567890 and shift numeric characters like !@#$%^&*().  The mouse is very well designed, very small, has a roll key that also works well.  NO MORE STYLUS!

  Think Outside did an outstanding job!  This little mouse works GREAT and looks cool too.  The size appears small but feels comfortable.  It automatically turns off to conserve power and all you have to do is left click to wake it up.  
  The mouse along with Think Outside's keyboard is a pair that cannot be beat!  They are both well worth the money.

These headphones are basically a pair of noise blocking earmuffs with speakers inside.

These are NOT light, NOT small and not the most comfortable.

BUT they are the absolute best noise blocking headphones I have ever used.  They are Noise blockers first, headphones second.

I use mine to listen to music while I mow my lawn, I also wear them during target practice.  I would not use them for travelling or in the office but thats ok.

Every one who mows their own lawn, works in a machine shop, or works around very loud areas should own a pair of these.  Protect your hearing and listen to music at the same time

I bought these headphones because I like to be isolated from the environment while I am studying. Without any music playing the Passive Noise Reduction of the headphones blocks most noises, you can still hear some loud noises (ex. from the construction side next to my building) but become very soft. When I use them with music nothing disturbs me, and I do not have to have the music too high. In addition, I am very satisfied with the quality of the headphones construction. However, the only drawback I found to these headphones is their weight, which is 15oz. Also, I found the sound of better quality and louder than the $20 Philips Headphones I used to use

The Koss QZ-99 is a very nice product, for certain things.  I would never recommend this type of product, without knowing the context.  I use it for listening to books on tape, on the street or in a gym, on an old portable tape player.  Since I am just listening to narration, I care much more about outside sound being blocked out than I care about sound quality.  If you use Bose headphones in this context, you are going to get much better sound, but that is a drawback: you will hear the crackles and rattles and pops on the your 8 year old Walkman and the 5 year old library book-on-tape.  Noise reducing headphones can be too good.  If I were listening to classical music on a CD player, in an airplane, a higher quality, and/or active noise reducing product would be better.  But for my situation the Koss is very nice.  I did not realize, until recently, that I could swivel the ear pads as well a lengthen and shorten the band between the pads.  It works very well

I ordered these headphones thinking it was noise cancelling, not noise reduction. The differece was that these are like ear protection devices like target practice shooters use. And the noise cancelling type use an electronic circuitry to &quot;phase&quot; out the noise, significantly. Also, the phones &quot;clamp&quot; on to your head, giving you aching pains after wearing for an extended period. The sound quality was alright, not much in the lower range, but didn't play loud enough. But the irritating thing was when you moved around and &quot;bumped&quot; something you could hear it, (the shell is hard plastic). They reminded me of my &quot;dads&quot; headphones from the 70's, in fact the design probably never changed

PC owners: odds are high that you need this to connect your computer to your iPod. Yes, it chafes that after spending several hundred dollars for a fancy digital music player, you have to drop another $20 or so for another cable, but that's just the way it goes.

The firewire end of this double cable connects with the AC outlet adapter and has the same functionality as the firewire-only cable packaged with the iPod. It's the USB end that connects to the computer. In order to synch up the iPod, you plug the USB cable into your PC; when it's finished and a checkmark appears on the iPod screen, you can unplug it again.

The cables are about six feet long, long enough to reach under a desk to the wall outlet or around to the computer. They come with cute little plug covers that snap onto skeins of cable. 

It would be nice if there was some kind of retractable-cable option, or if the cables were a little bit larger-gauge.

Unless you have a firewire port, PC and iPod users will need this item to connect and synch their iPod.

(My experience comes from owning the 3d-gen 20 GB iPod with dock connector.

I am reasonably sure this cable will NOT charge an iPod unless the firewire portion is plugged into the iPod power supply. USB only delivers 5V, and the iPods this cable fits needed 12V to charge (Firewire). So don't buy it if you think you'll be able to travel without the iPod power supply as well as the cable

This is a great product.  You do not need the Ipod dock to use this connector as it may seem from reading about it.  The connector clicks into the bottom of the Ipod.  You can plug the firewire side into the AC charger so that the battery is not used while transferring files and the USB 2.0 side can be plugged into your computer at the same time.  If you have any money left to burn after the cash you dished out for the Ipod, get one of these handy connectors.

Basically, most people don't have a Mac computer, so most people only have USB connectors on their computers. So go to TARGET and get this Dock Connector for $14.95. It works great for USB ports, and the great Apple interface makes updates a breeze. Overall, great product for computers other than Macs

Go to radio shack (or amazon of course)

buy a cable which plugs into your headphone jack (and then into the t.v. like an S-Cable /the three plugs, yellow,white,red.)

This will play video and music through your t.v.

Forget the remote. You can turn sound up and down with your regular t.v. remote and other reviewers have commented on the limitations of apple's remote. As for charging, you are going to have to bring the ipod back to your computer for upadates anyway and I'm betting if you are buying this kit you already have a car charger. The ipod doesn't run down that quickly. I doubt it is good for the battery anyway to charge every time you put it down (my old cell phone battery had problems because I never let it run low.)


Cost $10-30 depending on how snazzy a cable you buy. I spent about $15.
Also - I can take the cable and ipod to any stereo or tv in the house conveniently. 

Sorry - no sleek pakaging included or snazzy apple attitude included. Just a cable in a baggie. You still have the remaining $85 burning a hole in your pocket? Buy a docking alarm clock stereo for the ipod in the bedroom. You still might have a couple of bucks left over.

If you haven't bought any Ipod accessories and you want them, then this is a good deal for $100. 
Seperately:
1. Doc:$40
2. AC Adapter:$40
3. Remote:$30
4. USB connector cable:$20
5. AV splitter cable:30 - It's kinda short
(If you want to play video though just make sure that you turn on the video out setting!)

I agree with the other negative reviews -- the remote is too limited. You can't see the menu on the TV and you don't have a spin wheel on the remote.  Thus you're stuck just going to the next song.  Looks like the Apple designers spent too much time on the package (which is VERY sleek).
As far as the price goes, think of what you're getting vs a DVD player which cost around $50 or less (good remote that you can easily navigate DVD menus, cables and a the player). The reviewer who calculates $135 of value must work at apple or own their stock.  They don't even give you an S-Video Cable,which is what you need for decent video. Can't see this costing them more than $5 to make.
I'd expect that Apple is designing a better unit as the remote is of absolutely no use.  For now I'll just get a long cable that goes from a computer to the stero and wait for Apple to get tired of a lot of returns.  I really can't believe Apple would ship such a product ...  A remote with a "menu" key that does nothing???  Is this Apple usability???  or a quick grab for YOUR bucks

Apple's iPod dock is not worth buying.

The remote control is extremely limited; you can't maneuver through the menus as you can with the controls on the iPod itself -- instead you can only really start and stop music. And the video quality was not especially good.

After trying this out (and returning it) I ordered Kensington 33164 StereoDock, which is much better. You have controls that let you control everything on the iPod -- slightly clunkier than the iPod's controls themselves, but at least workable.

There are further limitations that appear to be in the iPod itself, not the dock. You don't see the iPod screen mirrored on your TV -- *except* when you are looking at photos and videos. So you have to have pretty darned good eyes to see what you are doing from any distance. And even to get that, you have to manually choose settings (in 2 different places) that let you see photos and video, instead of having the iPod automatically mirror when hooked up to external video

This box packages $135 worth of iPod accessories for connecting iPod to stereo and/or TV. If you do not plan on connecting iPod to stereo and/or TV, purchase what you need separately (you won't need Apple Remote and iPod AV Cable for sure). That said, included accessories are well built and stylish, perfectly complementing all but black iPod models. All that is missing is an S-video cable, which is a shame. S-video connection provides noticeably superior image quality over composite video connection. S-video improves color reproduction while reducing image artifacts, such as dot crawling around edges.

This package includes:

1. iPod Universal Dock provides an elegant way to charge and sync iPod, as well as letting you connect iPod to TV (for models of iPod with color display) or stereo. This accessory, along with the rest, is compatible with all but iPod shuffle and 1G and 2G iPods without dock connector. It includes adapters for discontinued iPod models. This accessory retails for $39.

2. Apple Remote controls the iPod wirelessly. This accessory requires the use of iPod Universal Dock. This accessory retails for $29.

3. iPod USB Power Adapter charges iPod without a computer. It requires iPod USB cable. This accessory retails for $29.

4. iPod AV Cable lets you connect iPod to stereo or TV set. This is a mini-to-analog audio + composite video cable. This accessory retails for $19.

5. iPod Dock Connector to USB 2.0 cable. Although one is included with iPod, this extra cable is good for connecting Universal Dock to USB Power Adapter for home theater installation. This accessory retails for $19

I bought the iTrip as a gift for my wife.  I thought it would deliver very good quality when using it for the car radio, but it was not HiFi.  My wife did not even try using it.  One day our 2 year old girl was insistent in listening to one song we did not have in the car, so my wife used the iTrip+iPod to play that toddler song.  Since then the iTrip+iPod has become the remote control of toddler music and stories in the car

This device is convenient and easy to use, but it rolls off the high frequencies, and therefore sounds very muffled, like bad AM radio.  It transmits only a few inches, so it is absolutely worthless in any metropolitan area where there are radio stations everywhere.  So, if you like your iPod to sound muffled with static, this is the device for you!  I ended up buying a Belkin Tunecast II which sounds much better - it doesn't muffle the high frequencies.  The Tunecast II does consume a pair of AAA batteries every week or so, but it sounds good -- and can transmit at least a foot or so, so that my FM radio can receive it

I was hesistant to buy this after reading the negative reviews, but I had no choice in the end as my car cannot be fitted with a CD player (due to factory installed tape player which is tightly integrated into the GPS/LCD control system) and the cassette player spits out the cassette type adaptors. I must as I was absolutely thrilled with it, the sound quality was pretty good (as good as FM can get) and the ipod can be safely tucked away in the glove compartment. I initially had some problem with static when I drove into the CBD area, but once I found a 'clean' FM channel, it was awesome

Sure, it's over-priced, but so are most of Apple's toys.  This nifty little device fits snugly into the bottom of your iPod and transmits to most non-music stations on your car radio, boat radio or home radio.  There can be some static, so it takes a bit of moving around to find the perfect reception.  Mine works fine in the glove compartment of my car or sitting on top of my home receiver.  It sure beats having an adapter to deal with and you can carry it out of your car for safe keeping

when this item arrived, I was very excited to hook it up and use it with my iPod mini. But when I hooked it up, I noticed that my click wheel was completely non-respondent. I sent my iPod back to apple thinking that it was the fault of the iPod, not the speakers. Well about an hour ago, my brand new iPod came in the mail. I hooked it up to the speakers and the same thing happened!!! DO NOT BUY THESE SPEAKERS!!! even though i was covered by apple, i still had to pay thirty bucks just to get it there. CTA digital better be paying for my iPod or I will be forced to take legal actions

I'm impressed for $16!  No noticable static/hiss noise -- even when turned up.  Full sound with good volume control without any distortion and decently loud. Acceptable bass for size.  Would be nice to have AC adapter included (why I'm not at 5 stars), but for a cheap portable alternative for your MP3 player this is great

Mine cost $17 with free shipping. I'd have been satisfied had they simply been adequate, but I was very surprised. They ain't audiophile, but they also sound like "real cans", as good or better than the competition costing 3X as much.

Pros:
flat response: some will call this "boring"
Extremely light and comfortable, especially for large heads
great soundstage
stupidly cheap
3m cord

Cons:
not sensitive, and need a strong source like an receiver. 

OK, that's a pretty lame con, as these are intended to be hifi cans, not ipod replacements.

If I compared them to higher priced stuff, then I might start talking about how the texture and timbre of the instruments is a bit lacking--but I can't really go there at the price point. For their intended use, at at the price, there are simply no glaring faults.

Tip: out of the box, sybilants such as female SSSSs's and drums can be painful. Let them burn in overnight mounted on a cantaloupe, and the drivers will loosen up. Sounds like utter voodoo, but the result was obvious with my pair

Basically, I needed a new pair of headphones after I got tired of the Sony MDR-V150s that my roommate lent me. I did not like the idea of having the "cups" right ON my ear, and honestly, they did not sound all that great so I decided to do some searching. I looked at Koss(I did not like any of their models) AKG( I love them, but, for $100, I did not get involved with them.) So, I decided to search some more..

I totally forgot about Sennheiser headphones. I heard them once at an ultra high end home stereo shop in Tampa, Florida and they sounded damn good. So when I saw these for less than $20, I decided to buy them..

First of all, they arrived sooner than usual. I put them on and I noticed something...I could not hear any outside noise. These "cans" really kept outside sound out. They sat comfortably on my head and the "cups" covered my ears. Score!! Now, for the sound..

I listen to a lot of music that I have on my pc. I have a Dell Dimension E310 with the ORIGINAL sound card and I have the Mp3s on Musicmatch WITHOUT any equalization. First of all, I chose tracks at random, all kinds and I heard things that I never heard before. I noticed tiny "cracks" on Avenged Sevenfold's "Seciond Heartbeat." Something I did not notice with the Sony's. I listened to all types of music and found the sound TOTALLY clean. No hissing, no muddy or "sour" midrange. Female vocals sounded great. Even the low end sounded great, specially with house and trance music that have a lot of heavy bottom end to them. 

BUT, I decided to try them on my Panasonic SA-XR55, which is a digital receiver, and I decided to "crank" it up. As I reached the higher volumes, the bass was lost, it sounded weak and muddy, but that WAS when I was pushing the receiver to its limits. 

These "cans" are great for listening to music at REGULAR volumes. If you want a pair of headphones that you can crank them up loud so they can sound like a car audio bass challenge, go for something like the AKGs.

Great "cans" for the money, I TOTALLY recommend them.

So here we go:

Pros:

They fit great, with even a leatherret piece on the top band of the headphones to keep things cushy.

Great sound isolation. I can't hear squat once I put them on WITHOUT music.

Gorgeous sound at "normal" levels. I do not care if you listen to Rap, Christian, House or Trance, you will get a great sound out of these.

Built very well. They look like they do not move or swivel in the picture, but they do, and are very comfortable.

Cons:

NOT made for LOUD listening.

Not really digging the double cord that comes out of the headphones. Single sided would be better, but that is just me.

And to be honest, I cannot find anything else wrong with them.

So, if you just want to get some "cans" that are great sounding, without breaking your wallet, get these.

Trust me.

You will thank me later.

You will be very happy with the noise isolation due to the good seal it makes over your ears.  The sound has have plenty of depth for my untrained ears.  Unless you are an audiophile you won't be disappointed.  If you are an audiophile, why are you slumming around $20 headphones?  The only downside with the 201's are they grip tightly enough that you know it if you wear these phones for more than a couple of hours.  I didn't have a headache, but my head ached a tiny bit

These don't sound very good, I wanted to replace a pair of Grado SR60 open headphones I use at work so I'd make less noise, but I really don't like them.  They sound very cold and small, like listening to a cheap radio in another room.  Even cheap earbuds sound better.  I didn't expect them to sound as good as the Grados, but to  at least be passable.  I'm just going to keep using the Grados, and throw these in a drawer or something

Prior to ordering these headphones, I really didn't know too much about Sennheiser.  I read some of the reviews on here and decided that I couldn't go wrong for my 20 bucks and I am NOT disappointed one bit!!

Whoever said that these headphones lack sound are out of their right minds; the sound is rich, crisp and very balanced.  I used the phones on my IPOD for those long bus or subway rides. I listen to a wide variety of music and they sound great with all genres. 
If you are a basic user like me and want great headphones then these are the ones for you.  If you want to go out and get advanced headphones (4 all the audiophiles) then you might want to shell out a little more cash.  

I am very satisfied with these Sennheisers and U WILL 2...ENJOY!!

Pro: Easy installation.  I didn't use the CD provided.  Just plugged it in and it began working as advertised.

Con: Can be cheaper.

Since most newer laptop PCs has ethernet built-in, manufacturers stopped making them and choices were limited. I was hoping that I could get one that would cost cheaper than wireless adapter but no such luck...they cost a lot more than I thought. 

Otherwise, it's a good product

I purchased 3 of these for my office back in October.  First the speakerphone microphone on the one on my desk stopped working most of the time.  I had been planning on exchanging the phone on my desk with a coworkers since I use the speakerphone on a daily basis.  My investors were out this week and were on a conference call on another of the phones, that microphone stopped working.  Today I had a phone interview and the THIRD phone microphone stopped working!  They work for 15 or 20 seconds, then the party on the other end can't hear you.  These are gone.  I was also hoping for a visual indicator that there were messages waiting when you use Verizon Centrex/voicemail.  No go there

The sound quality is very good and all the functions seem to work properly. Most of the features are very user friendly, easy to figure out. For the rest, the manual clearly tells you how to use them. I researched many phones before deciding on this one and was not disappointed. This makes a great office phone

We got this phone to replace some very old phones that no longer had good volume on the handsets.  We are in a two phone line office and just wanted a simple phone that we could use to answer either line and not have to read a huge manual to figure out how it worked.  This was the phone for us!  Great volume, speakerphone option, with several other nice options like speed dial, call timers, and caller ID.  For the price, we feel like we got quite a good phone and more features than we thought we'd need- but like the extras all the same.  I highly recommend this phone

Previous reviewer was right! This phone is attractively designed and works great with many features. It's the ideal home office phone. It's rare when you plug in a device for the first time that you get a feeling that a lot of thought and effort went into design. When I plugged in this phone I got that feeling when the brief test mode lit up the orange and green lights on the buttons- very nice designed lights! So far using this phone, I have no complaints, just a very minor gripe- if you talk too close to the mic in the handset it causes an annoying static type sound in the earpiece (wind blast noise). This is easily avoidable by talking at least 1 inch from the mic. Still, maybe noise reduction might have prevented this, not sure. Except for that minor quibble this phone is a masterwork of design and function.

I wanted white color but now I really do like the Titanium Blue color it comes in, and it doesn't look blue at all to me, it looks like a dark grey to me (which I like). Even though this is a 4 line phone, it's ideal for just one line use as well, which is how I'm using it for now. I can not review yet how well the multiline and conference features work since I'm only using one line at the moment. Even though this phone is expensive, it was the only phone I could find that had all of the features I wanted that worked well. I started with an ATT $24 phone, then the ATT 945 (which doesn't have caller ID) and finally this one, which has caller ID. I was also replacing a cordless phone because I needed a speakerphone, but also because I had recently heard that cordless phones send out as much EMF radiation as cell phones! The cordless base may also send out strong levels of EMF even when the phone is not in use. That kind of bothered me, since I sit by the phone almost all day long at home office. I found that you can buy an EMF detector that can measure EMF levels from devices in your home. I haven't done that yet but I think I will eventually. Since I sit by my phone almost all day I decided to replace the cordless with a corded and eliminate any possible EMF.

The main features I was looking for: speakerphone, headset option, mute, call timer, caller id, good audio (with volume control), and easy to read LED. It has these and much more. This phone has a superbly designed headset setup- plug in a headset (2.5mm plug) and switch very easily between the headset/handset/speaker, before, or even in the middle of a call. Be cautious of cheaper phones that have headset use but may not be easy to switch easily like this (requires a headset button).

The large LED has a bright green background that displays the black text very sharply and the menu system is easy to use. I figured out how to set the speed dial buttons without the manual. A column of 16 speed dial buttons on the right is nicely designed (each can hold 2 numbers for a total of 32). Push a speed dial, it dials immediately on speaker if you want. Speed dial buttons are easy to push and not too small (unlike lower cost models). All the buttons and controls on this phone are so well designed it's actually fun to use! When I first setup a speed dial, it didn't dial but opened the intercom. I quickly found the preference setting to make it dial, again without looking in the manual. By the way, the manual is very good.

When on a call, the call timer shows length of call. (some lower cost ATT models do not) This phone has intercom/page capability but I haven't used it yet. I tested the Do Not Disturb function- push the DND button and it lights up orange and silences the ringer- I called it and it did not ring- nice for when you do not want to be disturbed- yet it flashes the line button (green) if a call is coming in. A "New Call" light indicates when a call came in when you were away from the phone. Scroll thru the caller ID history to see who called.

This phone has no answering system- this is ok with me because I use local phone co. as my answering service.

The handset is very lightweight and the receiver sounds very good. The microphone in the handset is the only thing about the phone that might be improved, it would benefit from noise reduction, otherwise just remember to talk at least 1 inch from the mic in the handset to avoid the wind blast noise. I find this a very minor gripe because otherwise this phone is fabulous in every other way. The other thing I needed to do was replace the included short 3 foot handset cord with a longer one, but would have had to do that with most other new phones as well

I've been looking for a multi-line corded phone for months, and thought I'd found what I wanted in the AT&T 992, which recently became available.  It had all the features I was looking for, but the phone did not work reliably.  I bought and returned three of them, all with a different problem.

I then decided to try this phone, the 974, even though it's a 4-line phone and I only need two lines.  It has worked perfectly, and the overall quality is much better than the 992.  I especially notice a difference in the sound quality.  Unlike the 992, the line indicator buttons on this phone only illuminate when a line is in use, so it's much easier to see the activity on the lines.  A big advantage of this phone over many others is that all the lines work in the event of a power outage.  

I haven't used the conference feature yet, but all the other features--speakerphone, headset, caller ID, message waiting indicator, etc.--work as they should

10 base ethernet is outdated technology.  I worked for my school's info-tech department for a year and Netgear hubs were notorious for breaking, we have since switched to agere and have far fewer problems

That product gets a five start review because the ergonomics is simply **exceptional**. It's by far the best mouse I have ever had in 2 decades of computing. I really don't care about the fancy buttons (zoom and other customizable features) because in the end, all what counts is how comfortable the mouse feels (plus the scroll and back button) - to me, it's just a perfect impression. Before buying, I went to a brick and motar shop to compare different brands and models. That one was made a stellar impression on me. I think it's far better than the desktop model. The storable micro-receiver is a nice touch as well as the software power level indicator.

It worked flawlessly on several computers. I have one for home and one for work

It is true, as other reviews point out, that the scroll wheel doesn't automatically switch on this model from free spin to ratchet. 
I found that a disappointment when I first got it.
However, I left it in free spin mode and you quickly get used to it.  It isn't very hard to control to go slow and it does work well to cover lots of ground fast.
It does take a deft hand to use the center click wheel button in free spin mode... but hey... humans adapt.
I like that it has thumb buttons.  Hard to find a notebook mouse with that feature so far, and a center button on the wheel for easy use with tabbed browsing.
A little large for a notebook mouse... but what do do, ey?
I don't really like the slide "zoom" switch.  Too hard to use and I usually don't.  Doesn't provide enough feedback and feels like it will break.
Also.. it is overpriced.
I got it on sale though when it first came out and so far I am pleased with it in use.
Even with its flaws, and it being on the expensive side, it is the best notebook mouse I have come across so far.
Wait for sale maybe... and then jump on it.

This is by far the best mouse I've ever used.  The full-sized version of this mouse seemed too bulky for me, so I bought this so-called "notebook" version. The size is perfect, as it's not one of those miniature sized devices you normally see labeled "for notebooks."  This is perhaps 20% smaller than a regular mouse -- just perfect if you as me.  It fits the average hand perfectly (and I've shown it to some picky people!). Also, this is a LASER mouse, not just a cheap optical mouse, so the speed and accuracy is all there.  As for battery life, putting in a fresh battery the software utility estimated the life at 110 days.  That's pretty good for a single AA battery!

The free-spinning mouse wheel (which is weighted to keep it spinning) is really quite something. Once you get used to it, it's pure joy to use. It makes browsing pages or scrolling through long documents a breeze. Also, the buttons click with very little effort (almost a touch sensitive as an iPod wheel).  Between the easy-push buttons and the smooth scroll wheel, if you suffer from tendonitis or something this may be the mouse for you, too

.... Except a mouse pad. I use my notebook as a primary computer, and being a large handed guy I wanted a larger notebook mouse. Ergonomically this mouse is absolutely phenomenal, I can use it for hours. Ive never written a review on something but Logitech support is literally non-existent if you contact them. No one answers their emails from support. This isnt a one sided banter either. Look on the internet or through reviews, logitech support doesnt answer emails plain and simple. 

But to my original point. The mouse is jumpy. I dont know if its the wireless reception, or my wooden desk that Im using it on, but its VERY noticeable. I thought it might be the desk, so I bought a mouse pad, it actually got WORSE! After trying out a second mouse pad with a different material I got the same terrible results. As a graphics student I say STEER CLEAR OF THIS MOUSE if you want precision, because all your going to get is an over-priced over-hyped headache.

  It is just about the right size and shape to fit comfortably in your hand while still being small enough to travel. There are nearly infinite possibilities for customization of the buttons, which is both a plus and minus. All in all, a comfortable purchase

This mouse is overrated. I am right handed and have struggled with tendinitis in my right index finger. Bought this expensive mouse hoping the effort required to press the buttons on the mouse will be very light. However to my dismay it is quite high even more than the cheap corded mouse'. Not worth it for my use. I need something that will be a relief to my stressed out index finger

DEFECTIVE!  I can't say if this is a common problem or not, but my point sample of one VX Revolution mouse was pretty dissapointing.  Logitech may have over estimated their quality control when they decided to cram "over 420 components" into a little mouse, since the fancy pants scroll wheel didn't really scroll on mine.  

I had to hold the wheel over to the right to scroll, and the side to side scrolling was (fortunately?) almost imperceptibly slow so i could scroll down with the wheel tilted without it scrolling right.  Also, scrolling down went slowly while scrolling up went really fast.  Hard to get excited about form factor and features when a basic thing like the wheel doesn't work.  

It's going right back to Amazon, and hopefully from there to the QC engineers at Logitech.  Sounds like other people have been happy with it though, so I might still get a replacement and see if I have better luck next time.  

Overall though: if you have to roll the dice on quality, it gets 1 Star.

UPDATE:

Bought the replacement, and after playing with it for about an hour, i am ready to re-evaluate.  Getting a lemon the first time definitely still colors my opinion, but now that I have one that works the way it's supposed to, i can't help but say, this is one of the smoothest, cleanest, most comfortable mice I've ever used.  I'd certainly reccomend it, as long as you don't mind the hassle of sending one back if it doesn't work the first time

This mouse has a beautiful shape and all the human factors (ergonomics) are addressed in a remarkably elegant way. The only problem is that Logitech spends all their money on hiring the best product designers and then hires the most incompetent software engineers. The software provided with this mouse has caused all manner of issues with my Fujitsu laptop. I have tried reinstalling the OS and drivers only to find the moment I install the Logitech drivers the machine slows down to about a 1/4 speed and has all manner of mouse related glitches. I often have to restart the machine to get the Logitech software to work properly again. If I remove the Logitech software the laptop returns to normal. The most amazing thing is that the Fujitsu laptop mouse drivers work better than the specifically designed Logitech drivers. The only problem is that there is no way of configuring the buttons without the problematic Logitech drivers. I notice I am not the only one here with the same issues with their laptop. Given that this is a mouse for notebooks it beggars belief that the drivers are completely flaky. If you have a laptop then whatever you do don't buy this mouse as you will regret it

Motorola used to sell a Flexible Ear Receiver with a standard earphone plug (3.5mm, I think) that I used with a walkie talkie at work.  It fit my ear perfectly, and is adjustable to boot (sorry, Brian, but maybe you're putting it on wrong...).  It was about the only thing I could comfortably wear all day (I can't stand having one of those earbuds jammed in my canal).  I found it also worked great with my portable radio, CD player, and laptop (mono only, obviously).  Unfortunately, Motorola says they don't make that configuration any more.  The Receiver shown here is their new model, which has a much smaller (2mm?) plug.  If you have compatible equipment, however, this should be a comfortable and useful accessory.  It's especially good if you listen more than you talk - I could hear everything with the radio clipped to my belt as I went about my day, and when I picked it up to talk into it, people could tell I was "on the phone."

Ya know, there's really no point in wasting your time or money fooling around with different brands of cables when you could just wind up buying THESE cables instead and get it right the FIRST TIME around...

I can hear everything in my movies hella loud and HELLA CLEAR with these cables...  Even the TONE-DEAF can hear it!
Everything sounds painfully and perfectly accurate, plus there was alot of really nice, powerful bass.
Everything was hella pronounced and audible, not muted or weak-sounding like you'd expect...  Just in a word: "TIGHT"

Isn't that what we ALL wanna hear?

I mean, I only got the volume by about 1/4 of the way up, and I was totally satisfied with the level of sound in my living room.
Even at much higher volumes, I still couldn't hear or detect any of that unwanted distortion or so-called 'crackling noise' that you would normally get with them cheap-ass cables; so I guess that sound quality really DOES matter.

For whatever type of format you personally prefer to use let it be DVD, SACD, or CD; what REALLY MATTERS is that if you want to start hearing your movies and music WAY BETTER than it ever was before, then I say you should buy these cables RIGHT HERE, RIGHT NOW...

Get the BEST and screw the rest!!

This is seriously difficult to install.  It took me a good 2 hours to make sure everything was lined up properly, pick out the correct hardware (still not sure if I even did that right, but it seems steady so what the hell), and mount the tv.  Now that it's finally mounted, it moves well, but I don't even like to move it since I'm not sure how securely it's mounted - unsure about the hardware remember?  Well there were only 2 types of screws that fit - one was way too long, and the only other ones were long enough to go in - but only just.  They're in maybe a few millimeters - that's it.  So i don't move the tv around much.

I honestly don't know how they think average people are supposed to be able to install this thing.  If you got it for free like I did, then it's maybe okay, but i wouldn't pay money for it at all

I read one review that it was easy to install, not so.  Unless you do a lot of drilling in walls, and are familiar with the millions of pieces included, you'll be utterly confused.  The couple pages of instructions were grossly inadequate.  It comes provided with just about every screw / bolt you could ever possibly need (labeled in pouches A through O), but the instructions refer to pouches that aren't even there (e.g., package N), it's not too hard to figure out the correct package, but you'll still be somewhat confused and wondering.

Some of the equipment needed to install not included:  electronic drill bit (you might be able to avoid this with a hammer), an electronic stud finder (what apartment renter has one of these), and a wrench.

All in all though, once you get past the installation, the unit looks great, and feels like it's worth the price (super sturdy), though admittedly I haven't seen other mounts

All I will say is that I was away from home sent this to my wife she installed (says alot) and we were able to communicate.Image clarity excellent,set up is  a breeze and can be used right out of the box,the headset included in the package made this a one stop product and for laptop users the camera base shapes to fit  overall extremely good product

This camera works great for me. The onboard microphone picks up my voice up to 10 feet away, and I didn't have to shout so my friend could here me talking. He did notice that I was moving away from the mic so he understood why my voice was getting softer.

The head set works great too... and no it's not a right sided ear peice like the other review says. You can rotate the ear peice so you can use it for your left ear as well.  The mic in that head picks up my voice like a telephone would.

Video seems ok.  I wasn't really expecting super clear video capture, it does an ok job for video converence.  The problem I had for this camera between using Skype, MSN, and YM is that YM can't detect the webcam.  I've tried a dozen ways to get it to detect the webcam, even using an upgraded PC, YM just can't detect the webcam.  It only detected the Mic in the webcam. With that in mind if I have to do a video conference I switch to MSN or Skype.

All in all I like the webcam.  Just wish YM can detect the camera

For a cheaper cam this does the job!  I found the image quality was very good.  Only complaint is when it is darker.  There is a low light boost but unless you have on some background lighting, it is too dark.
Otherwise, daytime use is very good, and still pics look good too.  I would recommend this to others

This camera is awesome. It comes w/ a headset too that you can use when not using the webcam itself. The built in microphone is perfect allowing you to sit back and relax w/o being too close to the camera. The image is clear though it takes awhile to get the focus if you are moving too much (like when you are showing something using your webcam) but in real usage (just video phone) it is perfect. I love it and almost got another one for my family

I'm purchased many items on Amazon over the years and have never taken the time to write a review. I feel the pain of all of you who can't believe, like I did, that there aren't good headsets available - but less bad ones. I love this headset.  I've used and tested a number of different headsets and none of them compare for either my hearing clarity or the clarity of the person i'm speaking to.  Nobody can tell I'm on a headset.  I use a headset about 4 hours a day - both in the office and for my cell phone. At first I really didn't care that this one folds up but I find it very useful.  I can put it in my jacket pocket or cargo pants pocket without a problem.

My experience has been positive -- I have a Sanyo 7300 cell phone (with Sprint) and this was the best headset on the aisle at Frys.  I know because I called a friend and plugged in one after another, and his ruling was only this one made my voice sound clear and present, whereas every other one I tried was horrible.  Have since moved it onto a GE cordless phone in the house (no problems there), and will be buying a second to replace the cell phone one for the car.  Overall pleased

After trying several Bluetooth wireless headsets for my cellphone that made my voice sound soft and distant to callers, I decided to try a wired one instead. This Panasonic totally rocks with my cellphone!

The mic is right next to your mouth so you have way better voice quality than a headset that puts the mic way up by your ear. Further, eliminating the Bluetooth adds some quality and volume to the setup as well, not to mention better cellphone battery life. I can even use this headset with my cordless phone too.

I like how this headset folds up and even though it's a bit bulkier than a tiny little Bluetooth one, the quality and in call experience with it are far better. Callers are amazed that I'm even talking on a cellphone now whereas before they always said I was cutting out and sounds crappy. Now they rave at how good I sound and can't even tell I'm on my cellphone.

I have tried many different headsets from Plantronics and others. The headband always ends up breaking or the headset stops working well. My plantronics just broke since people said they could barely hear me, but my Panasonic is still working. I don't put the headset through the ringer so I have no idea what the problem is. Nobody has any problem hearing me with the headset on. It is comfortable and folds up. Overall a good buy

I have family all over the country and find that I am on the phone frequently.  These headsets keep my hands free so that I can take care of household chores while talking.  Every one has been able to hear me clearly with these and I am able to hear them.  I find them to be comfortable.  The only down side is that occasionly the wire from the headset to the phone gets caught on drawer pulls or door knobs, etc., but I think that would happen with any wire headset

If you're sitting on a call at home listening and don't want the kids and dogs to intefere... or on a cell phone in traffic, you don't want this headset.  The MUTE only works if you hold the button down the whole time. The mute doesn't stay on.  Needless to say this is unacceptable.

I got this headset to go with a new Panasonic cordless phone/answering machine system. I like the system a lot, but the headset is pretty hopeless. People on the other end can barely hear me; turning up the volume apparently only works on this end. Also dislike the mute button, which apparently must be held in to work. I'm switching back to Plantronics and ordering a new headset as soon as I finish this review.

I strongly recommend this carrying case to anyone with a TalkAbout.  

The case grips the Talkabout securely, is easy to access, and allows the radio to be reinserted without too much trouble.

The only flaw I have found is that the elastic band with the Motorola emblem runs right across the tone button.  It doesn't exert enough pressure to engage it by itself, but if you bump something it does have enough pressure to hold the button down.  It will set off the tone until you remove the radio from the carrying case.

I used this case every day for 7 weeks this summer and was very pleased with it.  I would buy it again without hesitation

I bought one of these cases to use with a T4800 that I use at work. This case seems to have been redesigned recently and incorporates a couple of fixes for problems noted in some of the reviews. The pocket seems to have been made deeper and the case no longer has an antenna loop. One reviewer has noted that the pocket is slippery and allows the radio to fall out. I've not had this problem in the 2 weeks I've had this case. The pocket is sufficiently deep and and of a more "grippy" texture than one reviewer noted and holds the radio very securely. 

I wear the case on my belt as I find that wearing it on my arm is slightly uncomfortable and the unit has a tendency to slide down. When I wear it on my belt, I'm able to withdraw and replace the radio much like a gun in a holster.

I highly recommend this product if you're using a compatible Motorola radio or are in the process of acquiring one. The plastic belt clip that come with the radio is very fragile and will almost certainly break with use

    I recently purchased these headphones and I am quite satisfied for the price.

    Sony MDRs have the flattest frequency response for any audiophile this is good.  The frequency range is amazing and beyond the hearing range of the average human ear.  Human hearing is from 20Hz-20KHz.  These phones go from 18Hz-22KHz if I am not mistaken.

    I wish that they blocked out more outside noise and that the wires didn't clack about causing annoying clicks in the ear sometimes.

    Overall these are excellent listening phones for sitting and listening to music in all it's quality.  They may not be good for running or listening to anything near traffic, however, they will protect your ears from damage unlike the stock iPod earbuds that destroy your hearing

These were decent at first, with the downside being the bass had no power. Even without decent bass the mid-high range was very clear so for $14 or so these were an OK purchase. About a month later the speakers are crackling on certain frequencies, so I decided to bite the bullet and buy a high end headphone so I could trash these. The annoying thing is that Sony even bothered to waste any time or materials building these.

These are not worth purchasing, but if you want to gamble on how long they last then be my guest

If you are looking for an inexpensive headset. . .try the Memorex HP2000. The HP2000 sounds superior to the Sony MDR-XD100 with much better bass response and has a volume and Mono/Stereo switch built into the cord. I use them in my home studio, not for mixing but for the musicians and vocalist to hear themselves. They are hard on headsets so I don't want to spend a pile of dough on them. The earcups get ripped off easily and the plugs eventually break but at $14.95. . .what the heck

This stand does a great job of holding the GPS stand and GPS where you put it.  Within reason, it stays wherever it will fit

It's a great mount but I ordered it as a package deal with a model Nuvi 350 GPS and it won't work with that model.... returned it!!
 Have used this item elsewhere and they work great, just make sure it'll fit your model

This product works exactly as advertised.  I mounted my Nuvi 360 to it using the Automotive Mount.  So far, I have used the friction mount in three different vehicles, two of them trucks.  With some rather rough roads and sharp turns, the mount has not slipped or moved from it placed position.  It's quick to remove the Nuvi from the mount and take it with you. The friction mount is designed to stay fixed on a lot of surfaces with different shapes.  I can't imagine a situation in a vehicle where a user could not find a satifactory place to set it for viewing the GPS while driving.  I hightly recommend this product.  I just wish that Garmin would see fit to include it with units which need a vehicle mount.  Having to buy the automotive mount as well as the friction mount is a pain after paying big bucks for the GPS unit

This is perfect for portability. I don't have any problem with it staying in place when turning. I use it on my boat and cars. It will sit on the console, as well as the dash, if you have about 8 Sq. in. of space. You do have to buy the Automotive Mounting Bracket that actually holds the GPS unit and slides into this Portable Friction Mount

Amazon shows this as an accessory for the Garmin C340.  I bought the C340 and this dash mount relying on Amazon's representations. The mount does not fit the C series gps.  I tried to communicate the problem to Amazon and the third time they acknowledged indicating the proper department would be notified so the misleading representation could be reviewed.  The return was a problem and I had to complain to get the amount of purchase credited.  I'm out $8.00 return shipping plus the runaround, and it's Amazon's fault I got the wrong mount.  Guess what?  The page is still incorrect.  Don't buy this dash mount for the C series, it takes a special mount and you will pay for Amazon's mistake.

I used mx400 when I bought Iriver mp3 player(they give with the player) and it was very impressive. First the base is really good, it has no cracks or other noises. also it doesn't break easily, and cheap, but sounds better than my other earphones that are more expensive, I think. I recommend this cause it's pretty worthy to buy.

They sound great, but they're annoying to wear as it's hard to keep them well-seated in your ears. When they shift around they don't sound as good. This is a problem with all buds of this design though, so if you're aware of that, these sound excellent for the price

I bought these because the price was really cheap, and they got fairly good reviews. I garden often, and am always listening to my ipod or talk radio. These kept falling out of my ears. Maybe if i find foam covers for them at the dollar store and try them out again, but from now on, I'm staying with the earhook designs, particularly the blue sony's found about everywhere for ten bucks. The sony's are pretty durable, as even with getting them snagged several times a day, i only have to replace them about once a year. Sorry, Sennheiser, i really wanted to like you too

These HDMI cables work just fine for me.  Now I've not used any of the $100+ cables that are on offer (and all you can get in Circuit City/Best Buy etc.), but I would expect them to be of a higher quality in terms of how they're made and the picture and sound they deliver.  BUT for less than $10 who can complain? They look and feel fine and deliver a better picture than the analogue cables I was using.  After spending $750 on a new HDTV, I'm not prepared to spend another $130 on a cable! Not to mention I needed two of them (one for my HD upconverting DVD player).  Delivery was prompt too, just taking a few days. I couldn't recomend these enough, given the alternatives at at least 10 times the price

I've had one of these for the past several years, using it on and off when wireless wasn't an option.  It has served me well and I really like how compact and convenient it is to use.  I find the build sufficient but nothing that couldn't be destroyed with a hard knock.  When using it, one has to be sure that the cable isn't recoiling all twisted or else that would damage the auto-retract.  I haven't had a problem with the retraction yet.  I don't use the telephone adapter too often but in the rare cases that I needed it, I was very happy to have this product on hand.  It saves me from carrying an extra cable and the telephone cable is sufficient for times when Ethernet isn't an option.  The only thing I would want more from this product is a longer cable but I don't know how that would affect the size of the product.  6' is sufficient for most situations but I wouldn't mind an extra 4' or more.  I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to carry around a phone/ethernet cable without the bulk/inconvenience of carrying the regular cables.  It is functional and understand that it isn't built like a tank and it'll serve you well as it has for me

Note:  This is a review of the Targus PA225U Retractable Phone & Ethernet Cord (Plastic Casing).  It's the rectangular model, not the oval shaped one.

I'm on the road 50-75% of the time for work and have used this on almost every trip.  I initially bought it because I forgot my regular network cord while traveling and needed to buy something quickly.  I like to be able to move around in the hotel room and use this cord along with a cheap little plastic cable joiner to connect it to the hotel internet connection so I can sit on the couch or bed while connected to the internet.  I've experimented with a travel wireless router but keep coming back to the wired connection when the wireless connection has problems.  I've used it for over a year and have never had any problems with the retraction

I am on my second one and I will be returning this one also. Both of them worked once and then would not retract fully after that. I was so mad I almost threw it against the wall. I thought the first one was a defect, but then when I got the second one I realized it was a design flaw... If you buy the Targus one keep your receipt because I guarantee you will be returning it. What I don't get is how Targus has the guts to release this product and also put on it: Satisfaction Guaranteed. What a joke..

I was quite surprised when I tested this out after going by the mostly positive reviews I found here.

The volume isn't configurable by the headset, but it doesn't need to be.  Sound is VERY loud & clear. Most headsets I've word don't come close to the sound this Jensen provides. I also get zero complaints from people not being able to hear me. Its seems I come across loud and clear to them as well.

You really can't go wrong on this one. It's a no-brainer considering the price

I've gone through two of these in the last three years and so far it's the best one I've used.  The earpiece is very comfortable and the pipe connecting to the mic is flexible.  The great part is anyone I talk to can hear me loud and clear regardless if I'm on a cordless phone or a cell.  The same goes for whomever is calling.  In fact, sometimes if I hold the headset away from me I can hear what the person is saying.  This is also good to use if you need to whisper. The mic can reach right in front of the mouth.  Over the years I've tried using the smaller handsfree devices that just slip on the ear, but the sound is often not as good as this one.  I've been told that sound between this set and the others is as different as night and day.  I'm always heard better on this.  The cord is usually what gives out for me because I handle it almost nightly.  Though I do wish smaller sets are made that work this well, I'd get this one again if I couldn't find anything else

okay, i had a glowing review for this product previously, but i've changed my mind after months of use. the sound is really, really, really loud, but your vocal timbre will be different, almost like extremely loud quality from a laptop speaker... some people found the sound to be buzzy and scrambled.

but i found a better one, though i can't remember the model number. it's an AT&T headset which is also bulky. not as speakery. maybe the noise-cancelling microphone helps. below is my previous review, only for reference:

*********************
i can't believe it... i went through 6 headsets (including jabras and plantronics), trying to find a headset that works well. this one, the earpiece is louder than anything else, and i never have to turn up the volume unless the other person is using an inferior headset. (it's so loud that i wear it a bit off from my ear.) the microphone is so good that i apparently sound lounder than when i use the phone without a headset. (some might say it picks up too much noise, but at least it picks up the sound, especially my voice!)

the downside is that it's quite bulky, and i won't know about its durability for a while, but i'm giving it 5-stars nonetheless because none of the other headsets even came close to the sound/mic quality of this model. why other companies don't make headsets with longer booms is beyond me. i highly recommend it, especially if you have a big head like me

I gave this product 4 out of 5 stars because it does not give a snug fit on my ear, however it does stay in place while talking and working in the kitchen, etc.  Those I have spoken with said they cannot tell I'm using a headset.  The sound quality was clear from my end as well. I definitely recommend this product

Ok, so I needed something to block out the train and people speaking and so on and so forth as i commute from ct to new york every morning. I tried lots of active noise cancellation head sets , bose qc included. And nothing, i mean nothing, kills off noise like these puppies. They're splantastic. First off everything, not just low noise is muffled out and with a little bit of music, all external noise is gone. The sound quality is not bad either and the construction of these guys seems like it could last as long as the head sets that pilots wear on aircrafts. More importantly, they were $37.56. I tried them on my cell phone(i liisten to music on my cell) the volume was maxed and they were about a level 4 out of 10 compared to my laptop. I haven't tried them with a mp3 player yet. However even with lower volume, the fact that they blocked out all noise made the music the only sound competing for your ear...which is great and my ear drums are giving me high fives because of this. Overall, I'm the happiest camper since charlie brown.If i had one complaint its that they make me look geeky...but who cares because i'm married and good looking which negates the geeky factor ;-

Initially I bought these for NASCAR races. After getting an iPod I realized that mowing the lawn could be a little less painfull thanks to these headphones. I now bring them on flights to help me pass the time in quite comfort. These are the same as phones offered by Radio Shack but the Radio Shack product does not have the Stereo/Mono Switch that these have. 

Sound quality is great - noise reduction is awesome. Reasonble price and free shipping. Hard to beat

I will echo vander-reviewers comments about this headset.  They don't cancel the roar of my Deere, but they attenuate it to a comfortable level making it possible to enjoy music while I mow.  It takes some adjustment to get it to fit comfortably over a ball cap and sunglasses, if not you'll notice some discomfort after an hour or so.  (Lucky vander-r, my lawn takes 4 hours on a good day.)

If you are looking to block the noise of people talking or other midrange sounds, active noise cancelling headphones WILL NOT WORK.  They are designed to block noise like the drone of engines on a plane.  

Passive headphones like this pair will block all sound at a wide range of sounds.  This specific pair works very well.  I was suprised how light they were, but as they have padding, they are still fairly heavy and I don't think they can be worn for hours on end.  

Overall, I'm very happy with them

I bought these headphones to help me study in loud enivronments.  They block the majority of noises, including traffic, people yelling, stereo/television noise from next door.  They won't block out loud noises in the same room (e.g. loud TV or person yelling), but I think that's good because you want to be aware of dangers nearby!

I'm no audiophile, but the sound that comes through these headphones sounds just like the quality that comes out of my stereo.

They fit a little differently from most headphones, with the connecting bar fitting behind your head rather than sitting on the top of your head.  I don't know if this would affect people who wanted to use these headphones while moving (e.g. commuting or exercising), but for those of us sitting down while wearing them, they are very comfortable

I like the case.  Good quality, nice leather outside, nice suede inside.  Looks like I paid more that I did for it.  The additional pockets on the inside are nice.  I put am 8x11 folded piece of paper in the large pocket and have put receipts in the other pockets and it does not compromise the shape or closing of the case.  Fits well in my purse.  Looks nice when taking and using it in meetings.  Slightly cushioned also makes it nice.  Has a small pocket in the center crease for stylus (or additional one if you use the slot on the palm.  I use my for my Palm T/X

...even if it does have 'Tungsten' embossed on the front.  The leather on the outside is fine cowhide, the seude on the inside helps to keep the T/X from slipping, and the fit to the machine is virtually perfect.  The padding is soft and should aid considerably in protecting the T/X.  I had considered not purchasing this case based on a couple of reviews I'd read, but I went ahaead and purchased it from Amazon.com anyway.

Out of the box the fit wasn't at all what I'de expected - it was somewhat like I'd read, with a bit of the screen obscured.  But, leather stretches, and with just a day of adjusting it with tension I got the case fitting the device like a glove.  It's probably true that putting media cards into the case could be a bit dangerous, but I haven't tried it, and can't say anything definitive.

This proves a little patience goes a long way

This in light of not covering the top and the bottem, its a really nice case.  I wouldn't  use it as a stand alone, as this is something you will really want to put into a briefcase or some kind of bag.   The dirt can get into the dockting pins.

Do not use the storage inside of the case, because you will only be pushing it straight into your screen when closing it.  I heard some people beaking their screens.  Its a nice case, no storage, but its not good for the straight out enviroment

I was a little hesitant at first after reading two reviews saying it doesn't fit Palm TX. I then called up the tech. support from Palm and they say it should do the job. I got the product yesterday, and to my joy it fits the Palm TX very well, and doesn't block the top portion of the screen at all. For 20 bucks I believe this is the best deal for my Palm TX

I purchased this case for my Palm TX, based on the prior glowing reviews.  I was looking for a nice book-style case made in soft leather.  I recently up-graded from a Palm VX with Palm case.

This case is far from a perfect fit for the Palm TX, which is suppose to be the same size as the Palm T5.  The top of my PDA protrudes out of the case about 1/4 of an inch.  The PDA would crack if dropped on its plastic top edge.  The case blocks the top portion of the screen, making it difficult to access some of the menu options.  I find my self constantly removing the PDA from the case to use it.  The case is not a good choice for the Palm TX.  Also, the leather is too slippery for my taste.  I fear dropping the unit.  The case has a cheap snap to keep it closed.  I don't think the snap will last very long.  

After reading the prior glowing reviews, I am scratching my head.

First thing first, this unit takes up BOTH plugs.  There is a three-prong plug and a second ground prong on the back.  There is also a screw that mounts this unit (semi-permanently) to the wall socket.  You simply back out the screw that holds the plastic wall plate to your outlet and screw this in, leaving the plastic wall plate in place.  (I probably wrote that in a way that comes off as complicated, but it's not.)  You can remove the screw from the unit and take it on vacation / trips with you for your laptop and what not.

Lastly, there IS NO WAY your plug will fall out of this device!  When you go to plug in your computer, or whatever, you wil notice that it is REALLY hard to push in.  The contacts are supposed to be that way to further protect your device/computer from having the cord accidently ripped out.  You'll find it's a bit overkill if you are using this for a device that requires you to plug and unplug it daily.  But I dig it.

I highly recommend this unit

I have owned many garmin GPS devices over the years and the model 72 is superior to any I have had. The cost of this device can be quite steep these days and for someone who wants to use  one for local areas-why pay the extra cost?  At around $150-it is a bargain.
It is remarkably accurate. I have closed on my vehicle in the desert under one foot and always within a meter or two. I can spend hours off trail hunting for plants to photograph and, when I am finished, I simply  use my GPS to find my car. I do not, generally, have any idea of where I have wondered. I simply do not trouble myself. I always carry extra batteries-user life is always grossly exaggerated by the manufacture. I also carry a backup topo map and a compass. Do not rely solely on any GPS.
I especially like the ability to download my hiking data into a National Geographic topo package for Arizona. You can use available maps to download  all of the data you need for a given hike into your GPS.  Garmin technical assistance typically requires long waits, but it is very helpful and it's on their dime. Great bargain.

I have tried a Etrex Vista, Sportmap, and a Gekko but I bought a Garmin 72. I like the 72 for use on my kayak where I can use  the large screen to see my speed three feet away. This unit has been  put  through the ringer and it just keeps working. I don't miss the mapping at all

Have used the GPS72 now for 4 months. It has been a pleasure to use.  The Garmin operating system is is easy to follow and the prompts make it unnecessary to carry the manual to use all of the features.  So far it is waterproof as advertised as it lives in my canoes and while not fully submerged is subject to splash and spray every time it is out.  Approximately 66 hours of use to data and am totally happy

This is a great GPS, probably the best I've ever used. I started with GPS in 1997 with the Garmin GPS 38, and three years later purchased an eTrex. I was satisfied with that, but when I heard about the added features of the 72, I went ahead and bought it to replace the eTrex. It is far more powerful than the eTrex and easier to use. The 72 makes excellent use of its dedicated zoom and menu keys. These alone make this unit quicker and easier to operate than some entry-level units. The display is of higher resolution which makes things like track lines more precise--a real problem on the eTrex, on which the track appeared as a thick black line that didn't show many meanders or fine movements. Many of the software features that the GPS 38 had, but the eTrex didn't, are included here, such as the ability to measure distance between waypoints, pan on the map page, and time-stamp marked points. The receiver in the 72 is very hot and sometimes gets you a fix within seconds. The software is apparently upgradeable and the receiver is WAAS-enabled, so it's ready for the next generation of navigation. Like most GPS units it's completely waterproof and it's worked for me under very unfavorable conditions. The third GPS I've owned and probably the last one I'll ever need to buy. Another job well done by Garmin

I recently purchased this item and have used it for about a week so far. I'm very impressed with the range and this headset's ability to shield itself from interference. There simply is no "buzzing" while downloading email to my BlackBerry while on the phone with this thing. I'm sure I'll be upgrading my PBX telephone system soon to suit this headset better; I refuse to use the handset lifter, since that seems so old-school for a headset so technologically superior than any other wireless headset offering on the market. It's important to note that a headset band, three different sizes of over-the-ear-loops and about four ear pads are included with this package.
The only bad thing about it, I can't seem to get the sound amplified as I like it loud. I think it was too much loud music played from my iPod that blew out my hearing, so the sound level should be perfectly accommodating to other folks.
In short, you will not be disappointed by the Plantronics CS55

  Yes thats right ,I wanted one so bad ,that I ran to the closest Best Buy and purchased the 256MB at $80. It kills me that I can buy this same drive for around $16. Its amazing while home and car prices soar, when it comes to PC's and anything you attach to it ,they continue to have more features for a cheaper price .I have not used this drive alot ,however when ever I did it never gave me any trouble except for the first time I plugged it into my PC which at that time was a P3 750mhz .PNY said for WinMe and WinXP it was plug and play ,which would probably be true unless you had a OEM install of your O/S and who ever installed it did not include all of the drivers for USB interface .I was able to extract the additionial files from the install .cab folders on my hard drive,and once it as up and runing ,I would just drag and drop what ever file or folder I needed to take with me,without any probs !
             Good Luck Nick

This is the worst USB flash device I have ever used. I was concerned about the quality of PNY products to begin with, but after using this drive I will stay away from any other products they manufacture. I have already had 1 fail on me when the usb attach part broke off after 2 weeks, and then another that, for me, was not machine washable. I would not recommend this product to my worst enemy.

This storage device has saved me more than once.  It hasn't failed on me yet.  You don't want to use this as your sole backup source but it does work great.  It's convenient and makes transferring files from one computer to another a snap.  It is also the new modern alternative to taking dozens of files of copies and papers home at night.  Instead just download it and you have it anywhere

First, anyone who would put all of their critical files just on this thing is nutty.  It's a backup device, very handy for moving files (images, .wmas) from computer to computer w/out burning a CD to do it.  If it pooches, you're out $35.  I am happy to report that it works after being washed.  Twice!  Don't use it as your sole source of critical storage and you'll be happy.  I'm on my second year with it now; still kickin'.  Great product

At first it worked great, then in just 4 months I lost everything. Apparently PNY offers a 1 year warranty - however, after being on hold in their automated queue for 20 minutes they hung up on me - I never got to a live person. There's got to be a better product out there. Good Luck

When plugged into the USB port, this product was recognized by both our Windows 98 SE and Windows 2000 XP computers, but did little else.  (The 98 machine routinely froze when trying to access it and the XP machine gave an error upon any attempt to move or create files/folders to the drive.)  Three different Macintoshes failed to recognize the drive.  The packaging did not include a technical support number.  The PNY website did not provide an obvious technical suport number, and none of the FAQs were relevant to our problem.  I sent an email through the PNY website which took two weekdays to obtain any sort of reply or confirmation.  Finally, when provided a number, I was not able to navigate the long option menu and talk to a live person without giving up and picking an inappropriate option.  

The technician I finally got ahold of at first suggested that it was probably the computer, despite being told that multiple computers were affected.  Then he suggested that the drives did not work well with Windows 98 and they would be changing the packaging to indicate this.  He was not very polite or patient, but he did "slip up" and mention something about many problems with the Attache drives.  Hopefully, I will be able to get this resolved by shipping back to PNY (at my expense) and getting a replacement under the warranty.  However, after this experience, I would be hesitant to buy anything sold by PNY ever again

This is a great USB flash drive. It works like a chrm and is quite faster than some other flash drives. Also no installation is required except for Windows 98 and 98SE. This is really good for storing just about everything. However this flash drive only lacks in tech support and size. However what I do like is it speed.(12MB/sec. = 720MB/min.

Now, I admit there are definitely printers with more bells and whistles.  Sure I would have liked to get one with the scanner/copier/fax, but I was NOT in a position to spend $100.

For less than $40, this printer has not given me ANY trouble.  I have had NO paper jams.  I have had NO "freezing up" or non-responsiveness.  I have had NO smears.  I use it for both normal printing, and for photo printing.

If you want to print 100 photos, I would recommend going to your local drug store.  But to do a few, this printer does the job.  For example on Mother's Day, I gave my mother and my sister photo montage picture frames (you know, they have all the different shaped holes in them), I printed my own photos and put them together.  The printer worked just as fast as I did,  I could pick up one photo from the printer, get it taped into the frame, and go pick up another one.  I can print 4 X 6 photos, I can print 8 X 10 photos, I can print all sizes in-between.

Listen to this!  I am STILL ON THE PARTIALLY FILLED INK CARTRIDGES THAT CAME WITH MY PRINTER OVER 6 MONTHS AGO!  Even though I use this printer every day!  I print photos, emails, recipes, payment receipts for bills, word searches for my niece, coloring pages for my nephew, postage and packing slips and address labels for my eBay business, everything you can think of - I print it.

I usually use the default "Quick-Set" for printing, but you can design your own if you need to.  When I am printing things for myself I use the "fast/economical" setting.  It sure is economical - as I said, I have yet to go through the first ink freebies I received.  I use the "general/everyday" setting for things I need to look nice.  I use the "borderless photo" or "photo with border" settings depending on what I am doing.  Or of course, I can manually design my own Quick-Set to use over and over, or I can just change settings on a print by print basis.
I don't know what more I could ask of a printer for this price.  If you don't need to scan/copy/fax, I would recommend this compact and eye-pleasing workhorse for anyone who doesn't want to, or cannot afford to, pay more than $4

I almost bought the one with the smaller ink cartridges until I read some reviews. I'm glad I did - for only a few bucks more I think I got a nicer unit.  Bang for the buck, can't beat it

I purchased this printer because I thought it would be faster than my other printer that was free. Needless to say my other printer is on stand by for when I need to print several copies of a document quickly. I give it four stars because it was worth the 40 buck and it got here so fast. TigerDirect is where it came from. It came like the next day. WoW!! I used Amazon because of free shipping. If I would have used TigerDirect.com it would have been almost 10 bucks more for shipping. I love TigerDirect.com but not the shipping. Oh and it prints beautiful pictures, even on regular paper.

I signed up for Dish Network almost a year ago and signed the contract for 18 mths of service which was a HUGE mistake!  Actually signing up with Dish Network is a HUGE MISTAKE!  The customer service sucks!!!  I have never had such POOR service in my life!!  I originally recieved 120 channels for 29.95 a month which they continued to mischarge me for (almost $100.00 a mth)  I am now on the family channel plan for min. channels and still being billed at least $50 a mth.  I have had the wrong equipment delivered twice and when they were supposed to show up the third time to exchange what they originally messed up on the tech never showed.  They have CONTINUED to bill me for the wrong equipment they gave me and still have not resolved the issue.  In the meantime I have spend OVER 20 hours in phone calls, tech visits, emails and have NOT even come close to having my bills corrected.  I CANNOT STAND THIS COMPANY!! I WARN YOU TO NOT SIGN UP FOR DISH!!

Don't get Dish! A word of warning - I got SCREWED by Dish when I tried to use the Club Dish gift card. With it you are supposed to get free installation, 3 months free movies, $100 in credits. I have called over 5 times and e-mailed more times than that and I get a different answer everytime I call as to why I am not recieving my benefits. Dish even told me I am not considered a new customer because their records show I had an account for TWO DAYS back in 2002! Which is a complete lie! And they are unwilling to offer me any proof! "The system is always right" is the answer I got. I would have cancelled my account right then and there, but I'd be out the $150 I've already paid them and from the horror stories I've read about returning your dish, I feel like I need to keep it. I HATE DISH NETWORK

I have been reading the reviews and have EXACTLY the same problems with my service with DishNetwork.  We won't even get into the customer service b/c that is just plain unconscionable, but my actual service is almost non-existent, I have to "restart" my receiver every time I turn on the TV if I want to watch anything other than local channels, sports, movie and HD channels NEVER work!  I have a 942 receiver.  Anyone else have this receiver?  I have reason to believe the company knows it is a defective receiver yet has not recalled it or informed its customers.  If you are having the same problems, email in to let me know.

I initially got installed this dish 500, and set up the international program alone. And clearly, when I spoke to them, they said, at some point later, if I wish to add on the basic american channel package, then I just need to call and pay about $29.99 more every month. And all of a sudden, when I intend to do it, they say, i will be charged $99.0 installation fee for installing another dish. Then when I said, what if, i dont want another dish, you may discontinue my international, and change my current dish angle, to get the american channels. Now they still say, just for coming home and take 5 min. to change the angle of my dish, they will charge $99.0. This looks absurd. 
In all, very poor customer service + rude way of talking + stealing money = Dishnetwor

I can't believe Echostar/Dish Network can stay in business the way their customer service must be hemorrhaging subscribers. They must rely on getting new ones because I can't believe anyone would re-up for their abuse.

I contracted for HD service and receiver in September and things were installed shortly after. Except that I felt the HD channels looked like crap. I thought it must be my TV, that I hadn't selected the proper settings or something. I'm not the type to complain until I'm sure a problem is not my fault. Well, I was wrong, it was THEIR fault. 

The "genius" that installed my system hooked the HD outputs of the receiver to the standard inputs on my TV. After I disassembled my home theater system (no small feat) I fixed that mistake.

Still no HD so I checked the programming on my receiver and found it had never been setup for HD by the installer so again I fixed his error. And again I had no HD so I called "customer service" at Dish Network. I found that even though the installer, Dish Network and I all had signed copies of the contract which proved I specified HDTV and paid extra to lease the HD receiver it had never been turned on. 

I asked that it be turned on and much to my dismay, sorry but I love that phrase, I was told that my recently aquired equipment was now obsolete. "Customer service" informed me that I would have to pay for a new install and equipment if I wanted HD and they quoted me a "special" price of $50. Well I checked the website and damn if that isn't the price everyone gets! The programming price would also be doubled. I was informed that this was all my fault because I didn't b**ch soon enough!

I asked if others who signed on for HD when I did were still getting the programming at the price I contracted for. Yes they said, but because I wasn't getting it, despite the fact that I had a contract for it, I couldn't get that package. Another alternative they offered was I could use my "obsolete" receiver and pay for the new programming but only get the old package. Twice the money for one fourth service? 

My advice? Cable, DirecTV or go without! Can you imagine what things would be like if the Echostar/DirecTV merger had gone through?

I though car dealers were the worst to deal with, but I was so very wrong. Dish Network tops the list of most dishonest and bad customer service companies. The problem is that they are the only ones with decent programming packages and they know it. I was charged $99 for an additional dish for international programming. I told the rep that I already have a dish and will like to avoid this charge. She said that if the existing dish is usable, your $99 will be refunded. Guess what, the dish was usable and guess what, now the $99 charge has become an "activation charge" and I will not get it back. So I end up paying them money for something I did not buy from them. I think the term for this is called stealing. On top of that they will completely deny any thing the sales department must have told you. I sometimes wonder that the company has created its policy to cheat and be dishonest. 

I do not know what to tell you. Direct TV has awesome customer service but their programming packages are just OK. 

Hope this helps all of you considering to sign up with Dish Network

1:  I missed the part where the other reviewer actually reviewed the product

2:  As for "have been fighting with their credit department who wants to charge me for 8 months of unwatchable service and the defective receiver(that I gladly offered to send back--they insist on charging me.)"

    Funny thing about a 12 month committment, you get a better price... IF you commit to a year.  Nobody is deceived on this one if they simply read the paperwork first.  It stipulates the length of the contract, as well as the fee for early cancellation.  In fact they won't let you cancel until they've transferred you to their "cancellation department" which reminds you of the cancellation fee.

3:  With 12 million customers, not everyone will get a perfect system the first time.  That's why all equipment is coverred under warranty for a year.  So there's a huge chunk of this story missing as to why the "defective" equipment was not replaced (a fair guess would be that the warranty is void if the customer causes the damage... kinda like every other warranty)

4:  And now, the moment you've been waiting for... the actual review of the DISH 500 assembly.  Quite simply it is a satellite dish.  It looks at two satellites at the 119 and 110 degree orbital locations, where all basic programming is carried.  It is a solid piece of equipment that lets you have just one dish where two were once needed, minimizing holes in your house as well as unsightly dishes on the side/roof of your house.

If you simply read your contract before signing it and avoid drunkenly swinging a bat at your dish, you should be able to avoid becoming a bitter man losing a credit battle, desperately venting frustration in a review that maybe 3 people will ever read... like others who shall remain nameles

I got bamboozled into buying a Dish Network system over a year ago and to make a long story short, had viewable tv for about 4 months of the 12 that I had it, spent more time dealing with their customer service (or lack thereof) than I did watching my unit, have been fighting with their credit department who wants to charge me for 8 months of unwatchable service and the defective receiver(that I gladly offered to send back--they insist on charging me.)  Absolutely insane how messed up that company and it's system is.  Cut to the chase:  This one is where I should have been with from day one.  Don't make the same mistake!  God help us all if Echostar (Dish's parent Co.) is allowed to purchase Direct TV.  It will be back to cable for all of us

I've been in the computer world for many years.  I am a die-hard HP fan but the past few Deskjets have not really had the WOW factor to them.  Until this one.  I just recently purchased it and it was hooked up in no time on my network, all 5 computers can print to it simultaneously and it doesn't have any problem handling the spooling.

I gave this printer a 5 out of 5 because of its quality, ease of use, print quality, appearance itself as it looks great with an all black desktop and overall satisfaction with it.

I recommend this to anyone looking for a good bang for the buck factor as well as an amazing product, once again, from Hewlett-Packard

Forget overpriced noise-cancelling gimmickry, these portable headphones bring the classic Sennheiser sound to a package small enough to bring to the excersize bike, isolating enough to enjoy in-flight, and comfortable enough to use all day at the office.  MP3 players, portable CD players, even computers have plenty of juice to push these headphones to rival the sound of some home stereos.  And for under $30? -- the decision is a no-brainer.

The only possible drawback is they are not small enough for jogging, etc.  Personally, I avoid the grating tinniness of earbuds and behind-the-neck varieties

I am very glad that I got these headphones because:
1. They are very comfortable contrary to some other opinions. My head is normal, not small and yet they fit weel.
2. They isolate the noise from outside. Sometimes I would wear them in my office without any music just to be able to have some quiet time.
3. They have a very good sound. I was alittle woried that many people perceive good sound to be anything better then those clock-radios for waking up, but these headphones are really great for the price.
4. We use them all the time. My partner listens movies, music and news with them from from the TV and the computer at night, so he really appreciates the lenght of the wire. I use them during the day with my MP3 player while biking, travelling, exercising, or in my office on the computer, so for me the wire is a little bit too long. 
The only complain that I have is that the wire seems very thin and fragile. You may find them a little too bulky to carry them arround, but that is the price for having the strenghts above. I stronglly recomend them for home and office and for anyone who likes good music and does not mind their size for outdoors

I think these headphones are great. Earlier I bougt the HD-202's which also sounded great, but those were unbearably painful to wear after a short time. So I returned them and ordered these. 

I think the EH-150's have a great sound for twenty-something dollars. I feel like the HD-202's sounded better in that they were crisper with the treble than the EH-150's. I feel like the EH-150s are a little muffled in high frequencies, but these were just so much more comfortable in comparison to the HD-202's.

I think value-wise, these are some of the best you can get out there.

Terrific headphone for the price. Passive noise reduction is excellent. The ear pad size is a bit small to be described fully circumaural except for those with small ears, but suffice to say amount of external noise blocked  (about 10 db) is enough to impress me. The bass response is excellent--they really meant it when they said there's "active bass" production. The extra thump is helpful in imparting an extra energy in modern pop and hip hop music which relies more on percussions and lower frequencies. The headphones are comfortable once you learn to adjust the ear cups to fit your ears. I have larger than average head, but I don't feel that the headband is tight at all--feels just fine, no distracting extracranial pressure. Design is rugged as well with thick cord and a sturdy, robust headband design.  Although the cables split into 2 for the left and right headphones, I seriously doubt this was a cost issue but more of a design property--in my experience, single cord headphones tend have weak connection between the cable and headphone that over time and use, invariably results in the loss of sound in one phone. Although the headphone comes with two Clarity is excellent for lower frequency ranges although the higher frequencies do feel occasionally muffled or at least diminished, perhaps overwhelmed by the stronger low frequency boost. Only qualm lies with the length of the cord, which, at 10 feet is excessive for casual use; 5 feet would have been more than enough for most. 

In summary: looks good, works WELL, economic price, simple, robust design

These have excellent sound quality with deep bass. The main complaint you'll read about any set of headphones is that they are too tight. That is not the case here and I wear an XXL snowboarding helmet (not all the time mind you - just when I am snowboarding or riding the bus to school). If they would be too tight on anyone, they would be on me, and they are not

I was hesitant about the U3 launcher software included on this device - but after using it, I've found it very useful. Ordinary flash drives are great for copying files, but this is something beyond that. The ability to easily sync Outlook or other emails, and to bring apps with you that run off the flash drive and not the host computer is worth the price alone. It saves me lugging a laptop between home and work. I can run Skype anywhere without installing it on a host computer, because it's installed on the device.

If you need just a straight flash drive, buy this or another device, depending on price. But if you'd find it useful to run your apps on any PC without installing them, get this or something with U3, you won't be disappointed.

Contrary to some reviews, you are in full control of whether the software launches on startup automatically or not - it's an option in the setup. You can remove U3 launcher and downgrade the device to a dumb flash drive if you want. You'll get an extra few MB of storage space if you do so. If you browse or use email from a U3 app such as Firefox or Thunderbird, you leave no personal information on the host computer - negligible traces from the software yes, personal info no

I have owned or handled close to 10 different USB drives and this one feels the cheapest.  If this were to be in a loose pocket and I were to sit on it, I am not so sure it would survive.  It has a very light and cheap feeling case.

I also to not like the color of the activity light.  Plus it is too bright and big.  It lights up the whole white retracting switch an orangish red color.  I use this for my USB mp3 player in my car and it is a little bright at night

This product looks ok, but it comes from the company configured as 2 drives, and when you connect, it forces the host computer to install some bull**** disk management software in order to recognize the part you can put files on.

Just FYI, on Mac OS X, it formats down to 1.78GB. (which is standard loss for any formatted drive).

First the good.  This drive is very fast!  I was able to copy a 500MB file to it in less than a minute! It's the fastest USB drive I've used. It has a small protective case, solid feel, a bright amber status light when plugged in, and a retractable USB plug.  And it's reasonably priced.

Now the bad. If you have horizontal USB ports (like iBooks/Powerbooks/Mac Books), the drive is too wide to use next to an occupied port. You must unplug any USB devices next to it to make room. The supplied "U3" is useless for Macs.  The drive always shows up as two separate drives on your desktop (which is annoying).  Contrary to other reviews, SanDisk's tech support replied to an email within 24 hours and gave me instructions on how to eliminate the U3 partition. Unfortunately, the instructions are for Windows XP only (which isn't that big of a deal since I have an Intel iMac with Boot Camp).  But users with older Macs will have to find a friend with a PC.

In a nutshell, this is a fast USB drive from a trusted brand name in memory devices. But ditch the U3 as soon as you buy it, it's pure (useless) marketing hype

I bought this drive to replace a smaller capacity Sandisk drive that I was very happy with.  However, the U3 software supplied on this drive makes it virtually useless.  The U3 software caused my computer (and another) to repeatedly lockup.  Sandisk technical support suggested that I use another application to remove the U3 software from the drive.  Unfornately, the removal application doesn't work any better than the U3 software.  I would stay away from any usb drive the includes U3!!

I bought this drive, in part, because it had U3, so I'm not complaining about that. U3 is moderately useful if you can deal with its shortcomings.

What I can't accept is how slow and inefficient this flash drive is. I copied a 207 MB XAMPP folder to the drive which took over 40 minutes and required over 420 MB of space on the drive. Copying the same folder to an external USB hard drive took only 4 minutes and 209 MB of space. So the SanDisk drive is 10 times slower and has more than 100% overhead in this case. SanDisk customer support was useless. They made no attempt to diagnose the problems, which is clearly inherent in the drive. They simply sent a replacement which exhibits the exact same problems. 

The replacement will be returned

I purchased my 2.0GB Cruzer Micro on a sale a couple weeks ago to replace my 1.0GB Sony MicroVault and I love it!! 

I'll admit, it was a little quirky at first on the loadup because of the bundled U3 software and it did create another CD drive upon installation as some mentioned, which I thought was wierd. I personally didn't have a need for the additional software, so I uninstalled it. And despite what some others have said, it wasn't hard and the software didn't reinstall itself. Ok, so I make a living working in the IT field, but c'mon, you don't have to be a geek to successfully remove the software if you don't want it, it's NOT difficult at all. And once it was removed, no more wierd CD drives or slow load times because of the U3 software. It works just as well as my Sony MicroVault, only I now have 1-gig more to play with.

As for the slider, this was the part I was most concerned with as any moving parts are succeptable to breaks. The slider on mine was pretty tight, so it took a little while to get it to work comfortably, but I carry this thing around with me everywhere I go and I probably work the slider at least a dozen times a day and it works just as good as the day I bought it.

My only real complaint is I wish I could afford the 4.0GB version. I would highly recommend this to my friends and family members if they were looking for a good USB drive with a decent capacity

I purchased this router about three weeks ago, and I could not be more satisfied with it. It was simple to install, and it works great. I can get a signal anywhere in my house and the connection speed is outstanding. I got the later model that allows you to turn off the lights, but they are not really a problem, at least for me. I also found it at Staples for a lower price. I did a lot of research before I settled on this router, and I'm satisfied that I made the right choice

I started with a Microsoft just before they quit selling them.  Switched to Belkin and it installed and worked well.  Bought the Netgear for Trend Micro security and parental control features.  The Netgear has similar signal strength to the Belkin, no noticible improvement with the Rangemax.  The Trend Micro software works well and having one license on the 6 connected PC's simplifies upgrades a lot.  The parental controls were not working until I discovered the overide was on by default.  I like the security features.  The installation and range get passing grades.

I have installed this router for various customers who need long range connections. The only problem it has is when trying to send the signal through 3-4 solid walls--but then I haven't found any that can do this. It is a cinch to set up, though you have to change the ip range if connecting to a dsl modem. Most come configured for the same 192.168.0.1 ip address

I was going to give it two stars because it did work ok for a while, but my boyfriend convinced me to give it one, because his argument is that this thing was top of the line and had just came out when we had originally purchased it, and we should never have had so many issues with it for the price we paid, so his logic won me over and one star it is. We didn't even have this router for a year. And as a note - let me say that I work for my cable ISP, doing tech support for internet, so my modem connection has never been the issue because I can check and test my modem from home. We had originally purchased this router as a replacement for our POS Linksys router, but that's a different story. 

Pros (sort of):
Whenever my modem would reboot or update, the router would usually repair the connection, which many routers do not do.
When it worked it did work great, It's just that it wasn't very long after we bought it that it stopped working (for wireless). We even got the compatible mimo usb wireless adapter to try and see if it improved the issue, however that was yet another headache (the wireless adapter that is made to be compatible with this router won't connect at the advertised speed without a BETA driver... which would let you connect for about a day and then the adapter would stop functioning altogether. When you tried to reinstall the driver it wouldn't let you - it gave error code 10 and the adapter wouldn't even load the driver so basically the $100+ adapter that is marketed as compatible with this router was completely useless)

Cons:
After a couple months it would only broadcast the wireless connection sometimes - at random. You could even be connected, it would then kick you off, if you refreshed the network list on ANY wireless computer, it still wouldn't show up until you had refreshed it several times, and then maybe in five mins it *might* let you connect. The router was on the second floor of our house, and the computers we use wirelessly are on the third, directly above it. Our wireless connection was actually so infrequent we had to run an ethernet cord out the window to the router downstairs, because about 85 percent of the time the router would not let you connect wirelessly. Neither resetting to the factory defaults nor firmware updates resolved this issue (nor did several hours with Netgear support, tier 1 and 2...).
You can't change the wireless channel to anything other than six if you are using the mimo setting.

We finally junked it today for a Buffalo WHR-HP-G54 (I'm going to give it a couple months before reviewing, because you never know about the quirks until you've had something for a while). So far the buffalo works great, but their firmware updates are a bit of a process...
Pretty much, today I was completely and totally fed up, because for once it was letting a wireless pc on just fine, however every fifteen seconds (like clockwork) on my wired pc (the one running ethernet out the window to the router...) it would say "network cable unplugged"... then within five or ten seconds it would reconnect and let me back online, and then fifteen seconds later it would say "network cable unplugged" again... Imagine over an hour of this... So I junked this netgear

This router works exactly as described, for me anyway.  Setup was very simple, and I have an "all-green" wireless connection from any room at home, with two different notebooks.  You can turn off the blue "disco light" by a simple press of the button in back, because yes, it IS irritating at night.  (Though I must confess that it is a little mesmerizing at first, and you may find yourself looking at the lights for a while!)

The only bad thing to say about it is that I DO sometimes (once every few weeks) get a disconnect for web pages ONLY (i.e. other TCP/IP services still function, such as newsgroups).  This requires a reboot of the router, and sometimes the DSL modem as well.  Prior to the router, this never happened.  But I'll deal with the infrequent disconnects to take advantage of the superior wireless range/connection.  Not perfect, but quite acceptable

We have had this router for about 6 months and it's cost about $1000 in maintenance time.  We have to reboot it every couple of days because:

1.  DHCP stops working.

2.  Internet (WAN) routing stops working.

3.  VPN passthrough stops working.

We already traded it in once.  The second one behaved EXACTLY the same way.  It seems that if there is any blockage or routing problem upstream (with ISP, it happens regularly), lots of features start crashing internally and then you have to reboot.

Now, add to that:

4.  Bangladeshi (or whereever) Tech Support is useless.

5.  Even when WAN pings are turned on, you can't ping your WAN connection from the inside to see whether Internet routing has failed (AGAIN!!).

6.  No alternate protocol support (other than TCP/UDP) in port forwarding -- needed for proper VPN support.

7.  TOTALLY USELESS logging -- web sites only.  I need logging of all ports and services at times to debug routing problems.


We're throwing this out and getting a Cisco professional router (if we can afford it...) or a D-Link or something

It's a gig of memory for anything you have that holds an SD card. And at this price you absolutely can't go wrong.
  It's 1 gigabyte!!!! what else do you want? BUY IT!

Someone mentioned that these headphones feel hot on the ears.  I don't agree with this at all.  Compared to my AKGs, which have plastic-covered ear cushions, the HD 457s feel much cooler and comfortable.  My ears do not perspire at all even after wearing them for more than 4 hours.  I think this is an excellent product and I would like to urge Sennheiser not to discontinue these headphones as I intend to buy the same ones after these wear out

I have two sets of hearing aids.  One BTE and one ITE.  These headphones work wery well w/ITE aids, but don't ask me why.  I really enjoy these headphones with my 30 GB iPod especially.  If it matters to anyone, I am an active octogenarian and a former music instructor.  I like 'em.

I would have to agree with most of the reviews below, the sound quality you get from these headphones is pretty darn good; however, they have one major flaw: it is IMPOSSIBLE to wear these things for mare than 20 minutes without accquiring a massive headache. The people that designed these things must have been too focused on sound quality to pay any attention to comfort (or even style for that matter, these things look cheap and clunky on your head). I dont care how great the sound is on these things, they were useless to me because I couldn't listen to anything for an extended period of time. I'm returning them asap and getting myself a pair of sonys (yah, I'm a sell-out, but atleast they're comfortable). I would suggest the MDR-V300's, my roommate has a pair and I really can't tell the difference in sound quality when I compared my Sennheisers to his Sonys (after playing around with the EQ of course, and they're about the same price as these too). Might I also suggest the MDR-XD300's (they're the ones I ordered as a replacement for these, and I'll be writing a review for those monstsers once I get a chance to try them out). Two stars instead of one only because I admit the sound quality was decent (not spectacular like many of the reviews said, however)

These headphones sound great.  For the money these are better than anything I've listened to.  They are 10 times better than the earbuds that come with most MP3 players.  They are not small by any means but if you want great sounding music, these are for you.  When people say you hear things in the music you haven't heard before they aren't kidding

These headphones were my first pair of Sennheiser's, and i LOVE them!  The bass is incredible, and it doesn't block out the highs and the mids.  When it comes to sound for me, i can never get enough bass.  These Headphones fit my needs perfectly.  The price for these is outstanding!!  If you are looking for a good pair of headphones, go for these, cheap, and sounds GREAT!

Keypad is not illuminated though which may cause some trouble in low light condition. Also, one needs to reset the date & time everytime if the base gets disconnected for any reason

This telephone's capabilities and performance are wonderful.  We have used it extensively and found it to be everything we were looking for and more.  Seller has great customer service; they responded very quickly and courteously when this product was shipping and I was in need of a tracking number.  Unfortunately (only in the aspect of rating their Customer Service department to a fuller extent) this telephone has not required any service and we have not had occasion to question any of its functions.  We are very pleased with both the product and the seller.  Thank you, Globazar

I recommend a buy for this product the only reason that I did not give it a 5 star as I know that there are phones with more features for more money.  I would give this phone 5 star for price and reliablity

I have been using this phone for a few months now and it is great.  Holds a great charge, clarity is very good.  It is a little simple in terms of functions e.g. not having a recently outgoing call list, but other than that, it is a great phone.  Highly recommended if you have a wireless network in your living area

I've had this unit about a year and have been having the same issues with "remote lagtime" and loud dvd tray...but I was put off so many times by Humax support that now I'm out of warranty. I too wonder if it is the box or the remote, as now the picture quality has been getting worse and worse. At the highest image settings, shows are recorded WAY too dark. : (
Checked all connections...tv...cable...etc. Even compared a VCR taped version of the same exact show tivoed in the other room...the tivoed one was dark and murky. Live tv is fine...it seems to be the way the Humax records now.
It's a shame, because having a integrated DVD recorder is a great idea...one I was willing to pay $300+ for and now regret

I had the same problem that alot of people here had/have, where the remote works fine and then after 2-4 weeks suddenly gets sluggish and makes you want to throw it and the tivo through a window. I even called Humax to get a replacement remote, and they were supposed to send one out but never did...

That didn't matter to me since the day after I had called, I took a nice pair of AA batteries (cheap walgreens ones) and stuck them into the remote and voila! Everything was back to normal, no more lagging, no more having to be right in front of the box and pressing the button a million times for it to respond.

I had taken out the batteries and re-inserted them and tried the batteries from our previous tivo remote, but hadn't actually tried any others by the time I called Humax (and they asked if I had replaced the batteries which I had done, but just not with another fresh pair from where I buy them).

So I am guessing that while the remotes and IR sensors may be a little bad, the main problem (or at least it was for me) was the batteries that they had sent with the unit itself...

As for burning DVDs and such, I have had a few failed burnings...

It doesn't like burning things in Basic mode for me, and sometimes the recording just got some kind of glitch/error while recording and no matter what you try to burn it on it won't do it (or will on a DVD-rw as the only episode to then move it to a computer).  

We have had ours for a year and a half and I have burned many things (movies, and easily over a dozen tv series) and have only had problems with 2 Alias episodes, and 2 other failed to burn movies.  But in normal circumstances, these DVDs would not only play back perfectly in the tivo DVD player, but on any of our other 7 dvd player items in the apartment (2 desktop computers, one laptop, one portable dvd player, 2 Xboxes, and our old standalone DVD player from before we had the Humax). We have used Memorex DVD's and even the nice and cheap Office Depot Brand DVD-R/DVD-RW's... which work great and are priced to afford plus have a Office Depot quarantee to work (can bring back to them if it doesn't)

This works fine as a TiVO and integrated DVD player, but the DVR functions do not work correctly on my unit.  DVDs recorded on this unit won't always play back on other DVD players.  When I asked customer support what brand players are compatible, they said "I don't know."  

Not all brand disks are compatible.  When I try to record on DV-R disks, it won't work on Memorex brand disks.  On Sony disks, it worked one time out of three.  Disks from failed attempts are ruined and need to be thrown out.  When I went out and bought some DV-RW disks, that recorded but then wouldn't play back on my other DVD player downstairs.  Even playing the disk back on the Humax unit itself, the fast forward and rewind don't work correctly.

Yuck.

I've had this unit for almost 2 years and it has been fantastic. As a long-time TiVo user, I often filled up my Tivo with shows (save-until-I-delete) that I didn't really want to delete. With this device I simply burn the shows I want to keep to DVD and then delete them off the Tivo. The DVD-burning is INCREDIBLY easy. Tivo and Humax opted for super-simplicity over more complex burning features, and I for one am glad they did. The DVD burning has always performed quickly for me and you can watch/record other shows while you are burning. 

I have never had the 'sluggish remote' problem that some reviewers have harped on. It has worked just great for me. And since the Tivo remote is the BEST remote ever designed, it is great to be able to use it for watching Tivo'd television as well as DVDs. Plus the Tivo interface is the primary screen on our TV, so no need to switch TV-set channels or change menus to watch DVDs. This box plus Netflix has definitely increased the ease and joy of DVD entertainment.

Nice touch: I've used the AV-inputs in the front of the box to plug my video camera in and record home videos of my 1-year old straight to Tivo, and then burn those videos directly to DVDs and mail them off to grandparents. Simple and painless.

For Tivo fans who like to hold onto programs and build up a library, and for those who are looking for a no-frills super-easy method of burning TV shows and movies to DVDs, this is the box to upgrade to

I bought my DVR 800 in November.  The Tivo service is awesome but the Humax Box is terrible.  There was a problem with the IR Sensor on the DVR.  I had to push the remote control buttons several (10+) times before it made a connection.  I called Humax, the customer service rep. said they are having problems with the IR sensor. She asked me if I had the latest software version on my machine...I did.  So she sent me a new remote control.  The remote was not the problem.  I called back and they sent me a replacement (new or used) DVR800. 

The problem still exists.  With the replacement unit - I have to press at least 5 times and I have to be physically close to the unit.  It's very frustrating.  I should not have to press the remote buttons more than twice to initiate a command. 

I bought a 40hr Tivo unit for a relative and it works great.  So I know it's not the Tivo service or the remote control. 

The Hard Drive and the DVD "recorder" works great - I was able to burn movies on a DVD and record shows with no problem.   It's just that the unit does not pick up the remote control signal easily.  

Not sure what I am going to do.

Before you buy this, google for "tivo humax sluggish remote". As of February 06, you'll see rumblings of a class action lawsuit about a remote control problem that has not been addressed by Tivo or Humax

If you buy this product, you're rolling the dice.  If you lose, as I did, you'll join a community of miserable Humax customers whose only consolation is the satisfaction of commiserating with each other on web forums.  

Problem sounds innocuous enough: remote control seems sluggish, unresponsive and quirky.  But it seriously compromises one of the key features of the DVR - many customers' primary reason for purchasing it:  controlling playback via FF, pause, rewind.  

Sad to say, users seem to have a better grasp of the cause of the problem than the manufacturer does.  May be a heat-related problem involving the IR sensor.  Humax blames it on Tivo's software - however, that's implausible on its face, as the problem doesn't afflict all units.  Tivo accepts no responsibility.  Hence, the "roll of the dice."  Are you feeling lucky?

You don't have to take my word for it.  Check out hundreds of posts at http://forums.tivo.com/pe/action/forums/displaysinglethread?rootPostID=10189479 .  

Still interested in the product?  Then, welcome to our world!  Misery loves company.

I have been using the regular Tivo and taping shows off of my pc. That takes so long! I bought this in the hopes that it would tape shows faster. I am not disappointed. It records dvds in about 1/10th of the time it takes to transfer them to my pc and tape. I agree that the image quality isn't the best but if you tape things on high quality they turn out really well. And, since it's so fast to record a dvd I don't need to hold on to a lot of shows until I have a chance to watch them. I just record them and watch later. This means I always have plenty of free space. I am so happy I bought this

This unit worked fine for about a month and then suddenly the remote became extremely sluggish. We now have to press any button 3 to 5 times before it will register. After trying all the troubleshooting tips and researching the problem online, we discovered from other users that this problem was not uncommon.

My Logitech Z-4 arrived a while back in the mail and I never got around to writing up a review. The reason why I only gave the system 4 stars is because I have never actually played any music through the system... BUT the system still deserves at least 4 stars without hearing the sound quality... and here is why. 

First of all, Logitech is a quality company and they always make quality products. 

Second, the system looks great and has great features to work with. 

The wired remote with a built in volume, bass, and power control along with a line in are a few of the useful features. Also, all of the needed wires are provided with the system

I cannot possibly imagine what the other reviewers expected. These are $70 computer speakers, not a multi-thousand dollar audiophile surround sound speaker system. For what these are, they deliver truly impressive sound - smooth, room vibrating, bass, crisp highs, and a midrange nearly perfect for computer games. If you prefer music, the midrange can be improved with only minor adjustments in a graphics equalizer - available in Windows Media Player (under "Enhancements" of the "View" menu) and any other decent media player. With a little equalizer tweaking, these speakers deliver exceptional music performance and are a true pleasure to listen to (rock, classic rock, jazz, or country).

Don't overdo the bass. If you're using an equalizer, leave the bass control centered on the remote (use this control to tweak individual songs) and adjust the bass up a very tiny amount with the equalizer. Many move equalizer sliders much too far, resulting in grossly inaccurate sound. Anyway, the bass should balance with the remaining sound, not overwhelm it (or steal power away from the mid-range, resulting in, surprise, muffled sound). In most listening environments, to add punch to the bass, the middle bass should be equal to the very lowest bass setting. If the bass is set correctly, the mid-range usually requires no adjustment. However, many listening environments also benefit from a tiny amount of additional treble (again, not too much - balance). All that should get you in the ballpark. From there, you can adjust for your preference, environment, computer's sound card, and connection (speaker or laptop headphone outputs). None of this should require anything more than gentle tweaking, not huge adjustments.

Are these speakers perfect? Of course not. I have over two thousand dollars invested in the speakers for my home entertainment system, with two 250-watt amplifiers driving those speakers. Now that is a system I expect near perfect sound from (but even it is tweaked with an equalizer). These $70 computer speakers, on the other hand, sound just fine for $70 computer speakers. Indeed, they sound better than anything else tried in this price range. My local store has speakers hooked up to allow for comparison testing. Nothing in this price range sounded better than the Logitech Z4. In fact, the only speakers with better sound were one costing about $160 and another costing just over $250. Obviously, neither of those sounded as good as the multi-thousand dollar surround system either.

One reviewer mentioned (in the subject line) that the speaker is not that loud. Again, I can't possibly imagine what was expected. These speakers are so loud, one would have to scream in the loudest voice to be heard anywhere in the vicinity of these speakers. These speakers are obviously not disco speakers, but, again, are very fine computer speakers.

The Logitech Z4 speakers are very easy to hook up. The only connection to the computer is the audio output - the speaker output of a desktop or earphone/speaker output of a laptop. Everything else plugs into the back of the sub-woofer (floor placement under a desk recommended). The satellite speakers sit on either side of the computer display, with the wired remote control located for convenience. The only controls, overall volume and bass volume, are on the remote. The entire system is powered directly by a wall outlet (no adapters). There does not appear to be a multi-voltage version available for international use.

The sub-woofer housing is made of particle-board wood (painted black with plastic silver trim) with a black metal screen on the front. The satellite speakers (black with silver speakers, trim, and base) are plastic balanced on a sturdy metal base. There is no cover over the satellite speakers. There is a single blue light on the power button (no flashing light gimmicks here). Finally, there is a headphone jack and audio-in jack (for MP3 players or whatever) on the front of the remote control.

All in all, I'm very satisfied with these speakers. Clearly some have different sound preferences, but I suspect most will enjoy these speakers as much as I do

Just plug it into your PCMIA port and on my computer with Windows XP it automatically detected the device and installed the necessary drivers. I may have had to visit the company's web site to add aditional drivers to get the card to work as USB 2.0 instead of normal speed USB ports but it works great now. You also may need to use the included A/C power adapter if you plug a USB hub (like I did) or 2 high drain devices into this card.

I use this recorder to record my voice which I pipe through Dragon Speaking Naturally speech recognition software into a text document that I later use for word processing.  It works great.  It's almost as good as using the microphone connected to the computer.

I not a musician so I don't know about some of the complaints raised in some of the reviews but if you are using this voice recorder for buiness - legal - medical - writing purposes you should do just fine

I share all of Adlevision's concerns about the Olympus WS-320. I bought it assuming it must be a sensational improvement over the Olympus DM series, only to discover that it is inferior! Yes, it is awesome that it can record for 35 hours in high quality stereo instead of 2.25 (so you can store an entire project on it), doubles as an MP3 player and pulls apart to plug directly into the USB port without an extension. However, the background hiss, regardless of the mode you are recording in and the distance of the recording source, kills it for any serious work. (At first I thought it was my fault -- I must be using it incorrectly). I do not need it as an MP3 player, I already have an iPod. The cosmetic changes are only that. I am quite dissapointed.  Back to the DM-10. Stick to what works well

 Over all this is a great voice recorder. This device picks up and records sounds very well. The ability to plug it into a USB port and transfer files straight to my PC in windows media player format is awsome. The controls are easy to learn and out of hte box operation even without reading the manual is easily accomplished. The only complaint is that their is no rewind at all. however you can play the recordings back faster or slower which is a nice add on. Tons of space to use and the ability to store songs like an MP3 player

 I own Olympus DS-2 and WS-320M digital voice recorders. I think that DS-2 is much better built, but it only has 64MB of memory which is a pity. Don't get me wrong WS-320M is still an excellent option if you consider it as a whole. The built-in mic is worse but you will still be able to make great recordings. I've done an extensive research before I bough my digital voice recorders and so far (2006) Olympus is the best choice in the $100 ~ $300 price range. Specially because it is light years ahead of Sony who always tries to impose their proprietary codecs down the consumer's throat, avoiding him/her to have access to its own recorded content. Shame on you Sony! These two digital recorders will offer you excellent recording quality, plus the ability to record using wma (windows media audio) which offers better quality than mp3, but still the same possibilities in terms of using what you've recorded on other devices. Not to say that I kissed up for Olympus all the way, WS-320M seems very fragile. Specially the on/off switch. It's almost an year since I bought it, and I pray everyday that its buttons won't die on me (specially the the switches on the left side). Please offer us a DS-2-like construction next time Olympus!

It works and does excatly what it is supposed to do.  It comes with two plastic cases (one for 20 and 60G) that fit over a heavy base.

For me the best part of this device was the heavy base.  This means when my iPod is not in it...it still stays where I put it

I have on the of these plugged into my Hi-Fi and plugged into the mains. When I come home I put the IPod in the Dock it starts re-charging AND is ready to play through the Hi-Fi - with no fiddling with cables. Guess I'm just lazy that way!

I can use my IPod with a IR remote control, with the remote adaptor plugged into the IPod's remote socket in the top. Why have I made this point? because if you plug into a Hi-Fi using the headphone sockets, remote is not available!

However, because the IPod connects to the Hi-Fi via the Dock via the bottom connector, the volume cannot be controlled by the IPod but is controlled by the Hi-Fi. Though I suppose I could program a Universal remote! (Though my Hi-Fi using Radio not IR waves)

However, I think the price is too much, and I would have expected a cable with it for this price. I would have given it 4 stars if not for the inappropriate (in my opinion) 1 stars.

Overall very happy with it and I find it extremely convenient

the only reason i shelled out the 37 beans for this thing is that i thought i could CHARGE and SYNC at the same time, and just leave the pod sitting in the cradle when i wasn't using it and it would stay charged. well, after a few days of sitting in the cradle i took it out, and was chagrined to see that the battery was low. wtf??  would it not take a charge? is my dock faulty? well i plugged it back into the separate a/c charger and its charging juts fine. which leads me to deduce that it does NOT charge for those of us losers connecting via usb. am i correct? (someone please check me on this.) what a ripoff. apple charges all this money for fancy packaging and design, and totally rips you off. ugh. SOR_REE for connecting with usb!!

The product comes the stand to hold the 20gb ipod and the 40gb ipod along with some electric thing where it gets connected. The bad part is that it doesnt come with anything else. Although it was my fault for not thinking about this, if you have a cover on your ipod it will not fit on the dock and you would have to take it off. The product description is very deceiving about the dock kit. It made me feel like it came with the right cables to connect it to my stereo. IT DOES NOT COME ANY CABLES! Unless you want to pay $37.99 or however much it is now just to make charging your ipod and playing it a little more flashier then go ahead. Just remember that the dock kit is ABSOLUTELY UNNECCESSARY TO BUY. You can do all the same stuff without it

The dock works, though completely unnecessary. I wanted to connect my iPod to my stereo. It sounds great !!! Unfortunately, it's sounds just as great using the headphone jack- which I found a 3.5 cord that splits into 2 RCA plugs at a national office supply store for $2.99. I find no difference at all in the sound. Had I found the cord first, I never would have bought the doc

This dock is a great accessory, but I think it should have come with the ipod. It is also insanely overpriced. You can get the dock straight from apple [...] for $30. That is a much better deal. That is also where I got my ipod. If you get your ipod there, you can have free shipping and 2 free lines of laser engraving.

This comes in really handy, but I was surprised it didn't come with an extra set of cords for the price. I basically paid $40 just for something to sit it up at an angle. If I had known that, I could have made my own stand. Apple really should either give you two dock kits for the price of one or include an extra set of cords (which would come in handy!) with the packaging. I wouldn't buy again or recommend unless the price dropped by about half the cost

I bought this for my daughter's digital camera.  I searched all over for this type of memory stick (without a great deal of luck)and this was the best buy.  My daughter was thrilled to have a camera that holds MANY pictures rather than the 20 some the camera alone holds.  If I am in the market for another memory stick, I will use this site again

The only thing I like about it is the sound quality is good. I can fit about 130 songs.

Cons:
It's very slow, everytime you go through your files you have to wait while it loads. It's pretty annoying, especially if you are looking for something far down the list and you have to wait each time.
I find it hard to use. There are so many times when I just want to go to the main menu and it doesn't go, and programming is difficult. 
I leave the player to choose my songs on random, but random is very weird. I'm used to players going through the whole list, never repeating a song, until all the songs are done. This player will play the same song you just heard 3 songs ago. Also, say you pick a song, and it randomly chooses the rest for you. Somehow, it memorizes that order or something, because say you choose that song again some other day to start off, it will play the same songs again in the same order. 
Sometimes I'll be listening to songs on random and it will just stop and go back to the main menu.

I really wish I didn't buy this, but the salesperson told me this was the best seller and he never had any complaints about it. I listened to him, even though I thought it was hideous. Don't buy this, spend a little more money and get an IPOD

Not ready to invest a lot of cash into an MP3 player yet, so I wanted something expandable and cheap. I am pretty happy with my purchase of the RD2315 Lyra. This one has 512megs embedded memory and is expandable via an SD Card slot (up to another 512 megs for 1 gig total).

This is my first MP3 player, so I am not sure how the sound compares, but it sounds good to me. No equalizer mode...but it does come with 5 presets (Rock, Jazz, Pop, Bass, ect...) Transferring files from the PC is easy via a mini-USB Cord (included). It supported USB 2.0 but 1.1 mode is plenty fast. No special software needed (I'm using Windows XP...it auto-detected the Lyra as soon as I connected it)...just drag and drop files and folders once it is connected. The latest firmware update allows up to 50 folders and 8 folder levels. It supports WMA (including DRM) and Mp3 formats up to 320kps.

The display has 3 backlight colors (red, blue and purple) and you can adjust the contrast on it. It has a cool flip mode which flips the screen 180 degrees so you can hold it in either direction. Fliped mode was easier for me to use (pressing the joystick downward is awkward in default mode). Flip mode looks just like the image of the Player on this web page, but the round part would be at the top instead of the bottom.

LCD response time is what you would expect for a passive matrix display. Processing speed could be better ("please wait" messages, ect..). The tiny joystick control could be better, but isnt awful. The 4 buttons surrounding it could also be better, but are useable. It feels sturdy considering it's weight (just under 1 and a half ounces). Controls arnt real intuitive...you will need to either read the manual or experiment a lot to figure out how to do stuff like jump to different radio presets. 

Although I havnt tested it yet, it comes with a line-in jack (cable included) that lets you rip CDs directly to it's memory...no PC required. You connect it directly to a CD player and just start ripping.

It comes with an FM tuner that allows for 10 station pre-sets. Reception seemed pretty good to me. A built in recorder allows you to record either voice or radio directly to MP3 (limited only by the amount of memory you have). The one I bought also came with an FM transmitter, which allows you to hook it up to your car stereo (plugs into your cigarette lighter...transmits your music over a very short range radio channel, which you have your car stereo tuned to...so your MP3 player plays over your car radio). 

It runs on a single AAA battery (included). Docs say it will run 50 hours or so. Comes with a neck strap and a replacement cover for the battery that doubles as a belt clip. The included earbuds are ok, but you will probably want to replace them with better ones. The firmware can and has been upgraded...the version as of this writing is 3.11. Firmware updates are handled from RCA's website (their site is actually pretty easy to use). You will need to download and install a small utility. 

I paid just under $130 for the 512 meg version as of Dec 2005, after tax (there is a 256 meg version as well, the RD2312). Overall I am happy with it...I looked at a couple dozen other MP3 players the same price and cheaper and didnt see any I would rather have purchased. It comes with a free copy of Music Match Jukebox (which I dont use, because I dont like it). It would have been nice to have had a manual included, but a PDF version is available free on RCA's website. If you're looking for a good medium/low-end MP3 player, this one seems pretty good to me

I now have had 3 linksys routers that work transiently and then quit.  There is effectively no honest tech support, only a group of foreigners who do nothing but stall and give you the run around.  The warrentee is useless.  I spent 8 hours with tech and got no result.  They refuse to authorize a return and warrantee replacement.  The products all died within 6 months.  Do not buy a linksys product under any circumstances.  Flush the money down the toilet. It will be more satisfying.  MD, PH.D

I've had two Linksys products die on me shortly after a year (a 4-port router/switch, and now this 8-port switch).  It works fine until it dies (but that's like saying a stapler staples correctly: it's supposed to).

Just to note: I run them in a very friendly environment -- no dust or heat or voltage spikes or any of that to blame for the problem.  (Also, you can count me as an "expert user".)

I myself will never buy another Linksys product again -- I'll try out Netgear & DLink and other brands, but goodbye Cisco/Linksys.    If you chooose to try their products, caveat emptor

I bought this switch because I trust the brand and also because I thought it would stack well with my Linksys BEFW11S4 wireless router (which I've run out of ports on). However, when I received the EZXS88W, it was smaller than in the technical description given by Amazon (which is actually the size of the box, not the switch itself). Because it is about an inch and a quarter narrower than my Linksys router, it does not sit nicely on top or underneath. I know that it's only a small complaint (otherwise the switch is terrific), but I just wanted to let potential buyers know about the possible size difference, especially if one is buying it specifically because it will interface nicely with a previous Linksys purchase

Even though there are some other displays on the market that use the same LCD screen and are sold cheaper, I still really like my Apple display. I've had it for almost a year and it looks very pleasing. The rounded aluminum edges on the top and bottom of the display have a feeling of disappearance, so it sort of blends into the environment. And when you're watching a movie or just typing something (like an amazon review) you just see the screen and not the display itself. Black displays are much more intrusive in my opinion.

Sony and some other companies made these flat displays recently with highly reflective coating on the screen, even more reflective than CRT glass monitors! I honestly have no idea what their problem was but those are very horrible to use. Not only do you see your own reflection in it, but it also reflects all the light from the windows and lamps. This Apple display has very low reflection factor. I have windows on the side and sunlight used to be very annoying (when I had CRT monitor) even with the blinds down I still had to put some drapes over the windows. But now the sun doesn't bother me any more and neither does the lamp behind me.

I won't say much about the colors, brightness and the quality of the LCD display itself, except that it's the best I've seen so far!

So why did I give 4 stars instead of 5? For the following 2 reasons! (if you have Apple computer this won't apply to you)

1) This monitor is labeled for Apple and Windows systems but there are no drivers supplied for windows (I have XP). When I hooked it up to my computer I couldn't set the maximum resolution (the option for 1680 x 1050 was just not there). But then I updated my Video Card (Radeon 9600) drivers to the latest ones, the 1680 x 1050 became an option, and I set it. BUT! To fund out about this took some searching, could've been easily avoidable if monitor drivers were provided!

2) Even after you update your Video Card drivers, the monitor still shows up as "generic" under windows. Some say that this doesn't really cause a problem that's not true however. First of all, the monitor has USB and Firewire ports on the back and although USB ports do seem to work (I didn't test firewire) they show up as "?" in Device Manager and this can't be too good so you might get a problem with certain USB/Firewire devices later on. Now that's a "possible" problem, but a real problem I had was with monitor shutdown. When you shut down your computer the monitor has to also shut down, what would happen quite frequently was that after PC shut down monitor would still be on. And even the power button on the side of the monitor would not turn it off! To shut it down, you had to crawl under my desk and unplug it from the power outlet and plug it back in. This sequence would reset something and now the power button on the monitor could work again to shut it down. Now I began to think that this must be a hardware problem and called Apple customer support which also thought so and recommended me to take the monitor to the repair center. I didn't really want to do that, so I gave searching another shot.. I thought that maybe it's the problem with the drivers. I didn't really find anyone mentioning this particular problem but this time I did find that some one recently released the drivers for this monitor! I say some one because it's not released by Apple. Some nice person wrote it for FREE. Yeah, really puts Apple to shame! After charging so much for this monitor they couldn't spend a little money for some drivers... Ok now that I got that off my chest, the little utility is called WinACD. After installing it, the monitor is recognized by Windows as Cinema Display and when you click properties you can even see some options. Also the ports and Monitor are recognized in Device Manager. The problem with my monitor not shutting down has also gone away. 

You can download the latest version of this free driver here: http://sourceforge.net/projects/winacd

Overall I'm very pleased with this monitor, though a little angry at Apple for somewhat ripping me off on the service and price

I have to say, this is a beautiful monitor. I already own a 23" Apple Flat Panel as well--and have never had any issues with it--I use it on my Dual 2.5 G5 PowerMac.

But what I needed was a good monitor for my stupid Sony VAIO PC that my company forces me to use. My company is very solid about not wanting to purchase any Apple products, but I asked for (and got) this 20" Apple Monitor to replace my existing so-called 17" Sony Monitor--it's really only a 15" with two extra inches of casing around the screen (at least it seems that way).

What a joy! This monitor totally kills the Sony display... and tears up ANY Dell monitor I have ever used. This, for the money, is well worth purchasing.

This clinches it... I WILL NEVER ENDORSE, CONDONE THE USE OF, or SELL ANYONE on PC hardware. Buy APPLE, you will love yourself for it

This is a great display, if you own one you will love it.  BUT, Amazon doesn't seem to have a box that it will fit in securely for shipping.  I received my original order, the box was completely destroyed and the screen was damaged due to being thrown around in shipping.  The second display I received had been treated even more brutally, and I had to return it as well.  I ended up getting a refund, because I don't want to keep dealing with this.  Don't let this review stop you from buying an excellent display, but be careful how you ship it.  I recommend you choose overnight shipping so it doesn't get tossed around for 4 days in the shipping process.  Sure it might be 30 dollars more, but you are already spending 700+ on a monitor so the 30 dollars to ensure it gets to you safely won't hurt too bad

I've had my 20" Apple Cinema Display for 8 months now.

This monitor is everything one could hope for.  Very highest quality.  Eye appeal plus!

Looks way bigger on your desk than it does in the store.  I almost went for the 23" unit.  Glad I didn't.

This great display teamed with the PowerMac Dual G5 2 Ghz delights me every time I sit down to it!  I don't see what improvement anyone could want ....

I was given a lot of bad reviews of the 24", and the 20" had raving reviews.  while the screen is the same as the dell monitor, if you are interested in aesthetics of a place, want to use the monitor with a PC and enjoy sleek designs, this is an expensive but good buy.

Until recently I'd been working with the 17" Apple Studio Display, the beautiful companion to an equally stunning Cube.  But demands of my work as a photographer necessitated upgrading to a Powermac G5.  I continued to use the CRT monitor, convinced as have been most graphics professionals, that LCD monitors just don't cut it.  The opportunity came to sell both the Cube and Apple Studio Display at a fair price, which left me with the decision of how best to replace the monitor.  Prices have been coming down for the Apple Cinema Display and from what I'd read, they're more than a pretty piece of hardware.

I've been using the 20" model for a couple of weeks and have to say it is both gorgeous to look at on my desk, and pure pleasure to work with as I prepare images for publication.  I'm both surprised and delighted to say I don't miss my old monitor at all.  Colors are rendered beautifully and I have plenty of real estate within which to work in Photoshop.  I have space for palettes as well as a good size version of an image.  I can't comment on reduced eye strain, but I'm happy to know there is no flicker in this screen and I have an unquantifiable sense that my eyes are more relaxed after a few hours in front of this beauty.  Apple scored big time with these monitors, especially at the current pricing structure.

You may be able to buy an LCD cheaper, but check the specs and look closely at the product before you buy.  It is rare to find a product that is truly comparable in terms both of performance and appearance.  Treat yourself

How often are you on the way to work or to a meeting and you end up getting stuck in the traffic jam of the century. Nobody is moving and you can tell it's going to be a while. It would make sense to brush up on those reports or your presentation while you're stuck, but who wants to eat up the battery on their laptop right before a presentation? This inverter allows you to plug in your laptop into your car - just like a wall outlet - no worries, work off your car's alternator instead of your battery and catch all your typos before you get to your appointment

This is a great headset. For its sleek format, it produces very clear sound, thanks to BT2.0 and EDR. The range is excellent - it covered my entire house, even across wooden walls and floors. It's got a great battery life. I use it for days between charges.

The best thing is that the transmitter hooks not only to iPod but to any mini jack, so it's got a great connectivity. At work, I hook it up to my PC and use it like a jukebox without the hassle of wires getting tangled up. At home, I hooked it up my TV and stereo system using a standard Y-adapter from Radioshack, and listen to movies or music without disturbing others. While I'm jogging, of course, I hook it to my iPod.

My newer laptop has BT2.0 built-in, and I was able to link the headset to it directly without using the mini-jack transmitter. To allow discovery, just press the headset power button until the lights alternate between red and blue. My cell phone doesn't support BT2.0, so the connection failed, but I'm gonna be looking for a phone with BT2.0 when my cell contract is due.

In all, this device will let you enjoy clear sound in style from many different sources without the worry of wires or range

I owned the previous version of logitech's wireless headphones and now I got the freepulse version. Wow! These headphones look great!! The sound is terrific and so far no interference when I put it in my jacket. The headset is very light weight and doesn't hurt my ears like the previous version. Did I mention these headphones look cool? The built quality is great.
Simply awesome!! The headphones comes w special attachments for each version of the ipod so the dongle stays in place. This is a necessity if u have an ipod

Lots of good things about this. Sound is excellent, it's easy to use, and seems fairly durable. A way to adjust the pressure against your ears would be an improvement, as the headphones get fatiguing after an hour or so. But for the money, it's great

I had mine for less than a month when the antenna wire pulled away from the magnetic part of the antenna. -I have to qualify this by saying that I did not install the antenna per the instructions. Because I live in a bad neighborhood, I can't leave something like this on the car- it would get ripped off. So every night when I got home I would carefully remove the antenna and put in inside my trunk. After a few weeks of this, the wire broke off from the magnetic part of the antenna. The exact same thing happened to my wife's unit. Maybe this would not have happened if we had installed the antenna "permanently", but let this be a warning to anyone who thinks they will be able to take this type of antenna off/on.

Now in our cars we are both using home antennas. We put them inside the rear window, which works very well

Wow, this was a find! I purchased it in July and have had no problems with it.  I actually purchased it from another site "refurb" and mine is FABULOUS! I am pairing it with an old Netgear WiFi 11b system, and when I was visiting family, they had the D-Link 54g and wow a tri-level home and I had outstanding signal.  So I give this a BIG THUMBS UP!  I am preparing to purchase either the Next or Mimo router this evening..so wish me luck

I bought this card bundled with the matching router. The router works just fine but I when I tried to use the card in an XP portable (UK Evesham) it produced a massive slowdown in the PCs performance. The CPU utilization went to 100% whenever I plugged the card in. Using SysInternals process monitor showed that 50% of the CPU was being chewed up by Hardware Interrupts, and the rest by deferred procedure calls. So something was very wrong. 

It may be because there were 2 wireless routers within range, one  a LinkSys and the other the NetGear both oeprating on Channel 11.
Whatever the reason, it was unusable

I have the rangemax router and this PC card and have had no problems.  The range extension is phenomenal.  The 108 Mps speed pretty much is only available at home since it goes with the rangemax router. Otherwise I usually get about 54 Mps locally. But when using the laptop on the road  (which is my normal mode of operation) I can now log onto access points I could barely detect before.  Evidently the antenna is pretty good for what it is.  I have not had a disconnect problem from the router but have continued to have the same old tired disconnect problems from the ISP and certain web sites.  The asking price for this is a little high but it shouldn't be difficult to find it on sale

Unbelievable performance... when it works.  Clearly Netgear has not worked out the bugs to be fully compatible with XP on this device... or the Toshiba Satellite Laptop motherboard has IRQ issues on the PCI controller.

The symptom?  A Blue Screen CRASH of XP.  It used to only freeze up the laptop (Toshiba Satellite) until I installed Service PAck 2 of XP... Now it captures the IRQ error.

My wife thinks RAngeMAX sucks... but hey, the performance when it works is absolutely FABULOUS (strong signal strength... a vast improvement...) but try to tell her that when she loses an hours' worth of composition...

If Netgear ever gets this hammered out, it will be a dandy.  Looking forward to a future driver or better Netgear admitting this is a problem!!!

Oh, how often does this happen?  Hourly, intermittently, daily... pick one.  There is no rhyme or reason.  And we've downloaded the LATEST drivers  from Netgear to no avail..

This may be a great card, but I have had to reinstall the drivers twice because it would not connect to the web via the Netgear Router.

Now I am receiving a message that this is not a digitally registered copy of the drivers, whatever that means.

We have two other cards on older Macs from the old "Airport" system which are trouble-free compared to this card.

Maybe its my computer, but this has not been a favorable experience for me

I have had the PC card almost 2 weeks now. The installation was easy and smooth. The card has worked perfectly, and is much more sensitive than my previous card. Previously I had intermittent access to the wireless network I connect to. Now I am permanently (almost) connected to the network. Downloads are also smooth, speedy and easy. I am very pleased with the card.

I bought this headphone in an airport. On the flight I used this phone to listen to movie, the sound quality was amazaingly good, it made the headphones supplied by airline unbearable to me. When back home, I  still very much enjoy this phone to listen to computer movies and musics, and carry it with me for the flights. It has a board frequency range, bass is surprisingly rich given such a low profile phone. Wearing is comfortable. With such a light weight, low prices, it is a good travel companion.

I bought these to use on my computer at work and they do the job splendidly.  They're lightweight and very comfortable.  You'd think with such a low price, they'd be el cheapo but they're really not.  Before I bought these, I had bought a much more expensive set of headphones to use on my computer at work and their performance is really just about the same

If you want value for your money, if you lose your headphones too often, if you wear out the cord, or plug on your headphones, these are the ones to get.  I have a couple of MP3 players I use at work daily and with them I wear my headphones constantly.  I either lose or wear them out whether they are more expensive or cheaper.  I was absolutely startled at the bass that came our of these phones.  It is deep, rich and accurate.  Overall sound is better than a pair I once had that cost me about 10 times as much.  Knowing that I would either wear them out or lose them I bought 4 pairs this time.  I will definitely buy more when the need arises.  An excellent deal, I highly recommend these phones.

You don't get a better headphone for five bucks!  Even though it's your basic cheapo design, the sound quality is unmatched.  Good bass and clear sound in general.  If you like me go through a pair of headphones per month, buy several.  You can't go wrong

It came in very simple packaging, with a very clear manual, and near idiot-proof installation software.  In less than 15 minutes, my Dell Dimension 3000 was Bluetooth-enabled, and less than 10 minutes after that, I'd performed my first Bluetooth Hotsync with my Palm Treo 650.  Unfortunately, I can't yet get it to see my Cardo Scala 500 headset, which I'd really love to use with Skype.  But I know that a given Bluetooth device may possibly not pair with every other Bluetooth device, but I'm operating in hope that product support from either Kensington or Scala can help still.  Otherwise, it's a fantastic little adapter and well worth the purchase price

I puchased this product with some hesitation as I am not known as a computer guru; however, I can honestly attest to the simplicity and effectiveness of this bluetooth adapter.  I have a Sony vaio laptop operating with windows XP pro; the directions were simple to follow and the product has worked flawlessly, and surpassed my expectations in use and range.  I would certainly recommend this product or purchase it again for myself

I bought this at Comp USA for the same price as on Amazon.  This product seems very solid.  The installation went very smoothly.  My Palm connected right away which is better than the nightmares I have had in the past trying to get bluetooth to work.

5 Stars!

Update:

A process used by this device frequently runs and takes a lot of CPU time.  It becomes apparent when my mouse is very slow.  I am going to check for software updates.  I still like it, but the CPU problem is inconvenient

A really good product. The software installs easily and works well. I've paired my phone, my wife's phone, and my Motorola H500 headset without a problem. Distance is good as I can go anywhere in my house without losing connection. It's great because I can simply unplug it, I hear 2 dings and my USB is free for whatever else I may need to plug in. I can plug it in as needed without a reboot and I've not had a single issue with it yet. My only dissapointment is that it feels a bit flimsy, almost as if you could squeeze it and it would split open. It also should have some sort of cap for further protection and possibly a case or something to keep it from getting lost. It's still a winner in my book and I'm quite pleased with it.

This thing is very heavy duty. When I first went to install it, I predrilled the 2 holes, but one of the lag bolts broke off in the wall. So I had to move it about 2" higher and bought some higher grade bolts (American Made Bolts) The bolts that come with it are CR-P! So before you install it - buy 2 new lag bolts. The back plate has holes for bolting the TV to it all over the place, so whatever TV you have it should work for it.

After all that, I still have to give it 5 out 5 stars.

I love the way I can just move my HDTV all over the place. I also like the way you can tilt the TV. I installed this by myself, but I DO NOT recommend doing it by yourself. But it can be done.

Get it from the Amazon link with free shipping. You just can not go wrong with buying this.

I put this in my home bar and it looks great. It is solidly built. I could not find a stud in the correct location so I put a large rectangle of plywood on the wall, painted it, and attached the bracket to it. The tv covers it and everything looks great.

This mount does exactly what you need it to do. The TV can come out at any side, away from the wall and any angle. We have it in our workout room and can move the tv so you can see it from any machine. We originally purchased a tilt mount, but then realized you could only tilt the tv, not pull it out, so you could only see the tv when you were right in front of it.

One mistake we originally made was having the electrican put the outlet right behind the mount. This doesn't work because the plugs get in the way so you can't put the tv flat. So make sure you put the outlet either above or below (preferably) the mount.

The arm extends and contracts with hardly any effort my 65-lb LCD.  It's actually a little scary since I expected for there to be a little more resistance than in actuality.  Just be mindful that you need 3 people to (safely) mount the LCD.  What would have been nice is if the wall mount and cantilever arm were separate items so that it would have been a little less awkward to attach the apparatus to the wall(stud).  Nonetheless, I have no regrets.

I bought this Microsoft Wireless Laser Mouse 5000 to replace my old Kensington wireless laser mouse, which was only 2 weeks old but I was so frustrated with it since day one due to its serious lack of response.

The Microsoft Wireless Laser Mouse 5000 is very easy to install, including the software. I am extremely impressed by how fast and accurate it responds to clicks and scrolling. The scroll wheel is comfortable and very QUIET as it turns. I looked at other reviews about Logitech mice where a lot users complained about how noisy some Logitech mice would make as you turned the scroll wheels. Not a problem with this Microsoft mouse.

I also like the two side buttons because they are customizable. I have customized the left side button to launch the Web browser and it works very nicely! I have not customized the left side button yet but I'm sure I will find good use of it.

The only one issue I have experienced is the mouse overall feels quite slippery when it is new. I figure over time once I have accumulated enough hand oil and dirt on the mouse, I will get better grip. I wish Microsoft would "rubberize" the two sides of the mouse like Kensington has done. Having rubber feel makes a big difference in terms of gripping the mouse and moving it around your table top as you mouse like crazy. 

Overall I highly recommend this mouse

Just bought this mouse from CompUSA and have installed the software in about 2 minutes. Mouse works perfectly. Very precise, easy, comfortable. I had an excellent Micro Innovations optical mouse for 5 years before buying this, and the feel and performance of this new Microsoft Laser 5000 is excellent. Highly recommend it. Also, note: I just reviewed about 50 different mice at CompUSA, and came away with this one for $49.99. Not regretting it. Quality mouse! Cheers

I bought this mouse based on the fantastic reviews, but was sorely disappointed. 

Performance is unacceptable, left-clicking works less than half the time, the way it slides about on my mouse pad is too slippery, and the fact that the wheel is not a ratchet one really bothers me - it just doesn't feel right, being so flimsy and all.

I have been a Logitech Mouse user for a long time. Both my home and work machines have them. I was looking for a wireless mouse recently and came across the RX Revolution by Logitech. Once I heard it didn't have a middle-click option I decided to look for something else. I did some research and found this little gem. It arrived today and I have been using it all morning. So far I'm loving it. It does take some getting used to, mostly the shape - I am used to right-handed mouse designs. Its neutral design is weird but easy to adapt to. Installation is a breeze. The mouse is fast and silky smooth, it is definitely a step up in speed and precision from standard optical. I thoroughly recommend this mouse

I recently purchased this and it's wonderful. I didn't really think I would notice much of a difference in going from wired to wireless, but I do and it's much nicer. My favorite thing about this mouse is the shape. It's large enough to offer plenty of support and the contours make it easy to use the side buttons. I would highly recommend this

Unlike thier sound cards, creative labs rests onl thier lawrals(you can tell by the snotty customer service with faked forein accents when ordering replacement items) on most other equipment, which is not more than peddled trash outside a "flee market" at best, this includes speakers, speaker stands and these "gameing" devices.  Like Microsoft's hardware what you get is an enormously expensive peice of trash that lasts six months at best.  How can ANYONE except paying this much for ANYTHING and only expect it to last SIX MONTHS! Customers should raise thier standards instead of thinking about "patronage".  The name printed on this is a gimmick, this guy does not indorse this pile(or does so absently and uncaring of how good it is in a game).  If you want good input devices I suggest Saitek all the way for everything.(except maybe the throttle crap).  Thier software sux but thier devices are solid as a rock and quite beautiful to boot

NOTE:  Mouse completely broken after 5 weeks - had to throw it out.  Original review follows:

I am a BIG fan of the Logitech Wingman Gaming mouse - in my mind the best gaming mouse ever made except for the lack of a wheel, a thumb button, and optical sensor.  Well...here it is.  Essentially the same design as the Wingman WITH a wheel and a thumb button.  My joy was unrestrained when I saw that this mouse had been made - as if someone had read my mind and made exactly the mouse I would have made for myself.  I had VERY high expectations despite the reviews here and despite the "Fatality" name which to me is a turn-off for any product (being a 34 year old physician I don't exactly start getting smarmy in the pants over products badged with a teen gaming idol's name on it).  But I don't care about the name - give me a good mouse and I'll buy it.  For me this is an upgrade from my current G5.

The good:
- just like the Wingman this mouse fits the hand PERFECTLY.  You almost don't even notice that the mouse is there.  
- The three finger buttons are in exactly the right place.  
- The smaller teflon feet make it glide much more smoothly than the G5 which tends to pick up dirt more on hard surfaces.
- Tracking seems good - on par with the Logitech G5.
- The wheel has a smooth, effortless feel to it.
- The weights are a nice feature...been done before, but a nice feature none the less.

The bad
- Yes the cord is stiff and short.  Not a big issue for me since my monitor has a USB hub but...come on guys, if you're going to do it, do it right.
- The buttons have a very cheap feel to them.  On the original Wingman the buttons had a perfect snickety effortless action to them.  These buttons are cheaper, more "plasticky," and reqire more effort to press.  Its actually hard to double-click with this mouse.  In my mind thats a huge gaming "no-no."
- The weights, while nice, are nowhere near heavy enough.  The G5 gives you at least twice the heft.
- Where is the thumb button?  Wha?  Was this a design mistake?  You have to practically take your hand off the mouse and reach back to get to the thumb button.  Very poorly done.

In all I do really like the mouse.  I think a lot of the negative reviews are biased by people who either dislike "Fatal1ty," or are used to the enourmous Microsoft/Logitech mice that you can rest your whole arm on.  This mouse has exactly the right idea with some shoddy fit-and-finish work which is really quite a shame.  If it fixed those problems I would be stocking up on them and likely would never need another mouse.

ADDENDUM:  I have now owned the mouse about 2 months.  It has gone completely on the fritz.  The buttons have gone to hell.   Holding down buttons does not result in continuous motion now but stuttering.  The optical sensor has seemed to crap out as well.  Movement is now jerky and erratic.  This is terrible.  I've never even owned a cheap mouse that had these problems.  I had to toss it and go back to my Logitech.  I still really liked the design and I hope that they can get it right next time.

The weight change is nice but as you hold the mouse and put pressure on the top, the weight releases up into your hand. The physical size of the mouse is too small, it does not feel comfortable. The cable is very stiff and lies in loops across the desk. After several ejections of the weight, many small pieces of plastic were broken off and were discarded. I expect that to be called a gamer's mouse all these deficiencies need to be corrected.  Very annoying - I returned what was left of the mouse and received my money back and all this trouble was in two weeks time, save your money and get a logitech mouse

New concepts and designs.  I am a practical person and really have never spent more than 20$ on a mouse.  I have had previous experience with Creative Labs Mice and they have been some of the best I have tried.  When I saw this new mouse I thought that this was an interesting concept and decided to take this for a spin.
The weight idea is ingenious and it does make a difference to the handling of the mouse.  I can say now that I have purchased this mouse without regret. 
Install is easy though I haven't yet explored all the ins and outs but I am satisfied to say.

I bought this phone a few weeks ago and so far it has worked great.  I've owned several different brands of cordless phones and I must say that Panasonic seems to be the best.  I also purchased a different Panasonic phone with anwering machine at around the same time.  Both are 5.8 Mhz and it's doubtful that I'll ever get anything other than Panasonic from now on.

There is an 'echo' noise in the phone. This is suppose to be   'free of any interference' but that is not true. I wish  I could return the phone but do not know how and it has been more than a month. I would not recommend this phone to anyone

I actually have the 5202M which is the same phone, but with an additional hand set. This phone works great! The CallerIQ is the only odd feature because to use if effectively you have to call into a service which appears to cost about $10 per month. 

The reception is very good but I can't go more than about 50 yards from the house before it starts loosing reception. Within the house it is perfect.

The speaker phone is great on the handset as well. I didn't think I would use the feature, but for long hold times or sharing a converstation or just working hands free, it works great.

I am giving it four stars because when you add a handset they don't seem to "work together" in the sense that if you pick up the call on one hand set, the other hand set logs it as a missed call.

I just received this from Amazon. I want to also commend the people at Amazon for their service. I bought this and used their free shipping option without realizing how much longer it would take with that method. I still received my TV a week after purchasing. Now that's fast!! I am also impressed with this TV. The picture is incredible!! I must admit that it helps to use the S-Video port if you have that capability. I just need to get a VGA cable for my lap top and I will really be set. So far just my cable and DVD player have the S-Video ports. Thanks Amazon for your quick service and great selection!

This is a great little unit. I have been using it on my desk for the last year, and it works flawlessly. The only issues are the delay when switching between inputs and sometime the PIP stays on when it is supposed to be off. I have also hooked up my xbox and computer to it, and it is a great system. The swivel base and carry handle are two great  features. I would rate it an economic buy, and not a top of the line unit, based on the color settings and the image.

Very nice new technology. I have only used it as a video monitor so far. Biggest complaint is NO color level adjustment on video!! and the level seems to be too high. Adjusting brightness &amp; contrast somewhat changes the color levels but at the expense of over compensation. Sound is poor

This ink tank is the same size, and shape and fits the Pixma MP800 all-in-one printer but it does not work.  Even though it is for photos and has photo in the name, this only works with the Pixma iP6600D or the Pixma MP950.  The correct ink tank replacement for the Pixma MP800 is the CLI-8M.  The items are to closely labeled and easily confused especially when you are thinking of printing photos

Here are the pros of the iPod integration: Charges the iPod while I drive so it is always fully charged, the sound quality is great (much better than with the FM transmitters), and finally it keeps the iPod out of sight. Cons of Alpines iPod integration: THE INTERFACE SUCKS, THE INTERFACE SUCKS, THE INTERFACE SUCKS. Let me explain, the iPod is wonderful because it is so easy to use, however when ever you connect the iPod to the Alpine deck it blocks out the iPod controls so it can only be controlled from the stereo deck. This wouldn't be so bad except that the deck does a horrible job of controlling the iPod for two reasons, first because there is a huge lag time when browsing through songs, playlists, or artists. And secondly because the interface is so complicated to use, you have to understand that for me to have to read a manual for a piece of electroincs in pretty rare but for this thing I keep the manual in the glove box because it is so hard to use I have to read up on it every time I want to use it. Just browsing for a song can take as many as 6 button presses (which all have to be in correct order). I hear a second generation interface will soon be out, and I would suggest holding out for that

This is an absolutely amazing product by the guys at alpine.  Having all 6500 songs (and counting) in my car at all times is a dream come true.  If you have a compatible alpine cd player, get this so you never have to lug a bunch of cd's in your car ever again

I had purchased an Alpine CDA 9847 a few months back for my wife's minivan, which I now drive. (If I have to drive a minivan, it better have good tunes!) The salesman had mentioned that an ipod interface was available, but at the time, I didn't have an ipod and didn't think I would ever use this feature.
In fact, I was all set to purchase an FM transmitter solution for my newly purchased ipod 30gb video, when I remembered that there was a direct interface option for the Alpine.
I also considered just purchasing a simple AI-NET cable (KCA-121B) mainly due to some negative reviews that I had read about searching for songs on the Alpine.
Let me tell you that both the sound quality and "searchability" of the Alpine are mind blowing. The first song that I played was Angie by the Rolling stones. The simple guitar and piano combo was crystal clear. Stereo separation was great. My ipod was low on battery when I hooked it up. After 15 minutes of playing, the battery was back up to half due to the built-in charger.
I installed it myself and saved the $70. It took about 30 minutes. When you plug in the ipod, the screen on the ipod displays an Alpine logo! You can put it away, because after you plug it in, you won't touch it. You can search on your Alpine by the same Playlist/Artist/Album/Song modes that you can on the ipod. The artist and song scroll across the radio!
One complaint, more for the radio than the interface - there is a downside to using the volume control as the scrolling device. Sometimes when you switch to a loud song, you want to turn it down right away, but you have to first come out of search mode. Luckily there is a mute button nearby.
If you have a new Alpine radio that supports the Alpine ipod interface, I would highly recommend it, especially compared to an FM based solution.

I purchased an Alpine KCA-420i iPod interface for my car, a 1994 Toyota Camry. The product consists of the interface box, an Alpine Ai-net cable, and an iPod dock cable. The head unit I have is an Alpine CDA-9833. Different head units do not make much difference on the features that the interface has. The main differences are button combinations for controlling the interface, and the display of information on the head unit.

Installation of the interface was fairly simple for my car. If you don't know what you are doing, you'll need to have this device professionally installed. If you know a little bit about what you are doing, you should be able to find a place to hide the interface box and route the cables. I spent approximately 45 minutes completing the entire installation, and I've never done an install before. Once the unit is installed, it is completely hidden and nobody would even know it is there. The iPod is tucked inside of the hinged pocket under the stereo, the control box is inside the glove compartment, and the cables run inside the dashboard.

To get started with the interface, just plug the cable into the dock connector on the bottom of the iPod. The Alpine logo appears on the screen, letting you know that it is connected. The controls on the iPod will not function while attached to the interface, so everything is done through the stereo. The interface appears as a CD changer to the stereo. It is probably best if one reads the Quick Reference that comes with the interface to learn the controls, as it is not completely intuitive.

The sound quality is excellent, as it is a line connection to the stereo. The quality is the same as MP3 CDs listened to on the CD player. As I mentioned, the controls are not completely intuitive. The unit appears as a CD-Changer, so browsing is done by selecting different "CDs". To choose playlists, you must press "1" to choose "Disc 1", and then use the Quick Search to find the playlist you want. Similarly, artists are browsed using "Disc 2" and Albums using "Disc 3". You can browse for songs while listening without interrupting the current song, similarly to when listening to a regular CD. The difference is that browsing is a little slower, because it has to get the information from the iPod as you are browsing. It is slightly more difficult than using the iPod on its own, because there is no acceleration when turning the dial, so if you have many artists/albums/songs, it can take awhile to find the one you want.

Overall, the KCA-420i is a great product with minor shortfalls. It is a very nice addition to an Alpine car stereo if one owns an iPod. It lets you have your entire music collection with you, without the hassle of ever needing CDs for the car or using FM transmitters with lower sound quality. It also charges your iPod while you are using it. The entire setup can be hidden away so that you don't have the additional clutter of cigarette power adapters and docking stations, and their associated cables. The price is low enough that it isn't a huge investment. The sound quality and integration are wonderful, and it's very nice having all of the music information and controls available in one place on the head unit so that one can concentrate on driving. The only thing keeping this from a five-star rating is that the controls are slightly unintuitive. Once you learn them, though, it is easy to use.

PROS:
Excellent sound quality
Integration with head unit
Keeps the iPod charged
Appearance (or lack of appearance, as it is completely hidden!)
Price

CONS:
Controls are slightly unintuitive
Installation could be an additional expense if one does not know how to do it oneself

I would thoroughly recommend purchasing this if you have an Alpine stereo and an iPod, and you want the most integrated way to use them together while keeping your car from having iPod accessories everywhere

July 2006.  After testing the Jwin, Griffen 30BK, Edge DiskGO, and the Kensington Pico, and the MITO, the MITO wins hands down.  The JWIN is not plug and play and presented quite a bit of static, the Griffin could not muster the volume, as was the case with the Kensington, and the Edge was just a P.O.S., with no stereo transmission, and a battery door that would not close.  My test was specifically for transmission to a Panasonic Boom box, used while on vacation.  In both N.J. and N.C., the MITO performed well, with little static, and plenty of volume for those late night jam sessions after the kids and wives were asleep.  Go with the MITO, you won't be sorry

I could get it to work, but the sound quality was very poor.  This is the second type of FM transmitter I have tried - the search is on again I guess.  I suppose with these things it is trial and error until you find one that works.  I liked the fact that you could use this one with any radio, not just in the car, but I may have to resort to the "car only" type.  If all I can hear is static, forget it

I got this because it was the smallest FM transmitter for the iPOD Nano.  It integrated well with the iPOD, and I had no problems using it to select the station.  The real problem was static.  I tried multiple "clear" FM channels in the Nashville area, but I could not get a nice clean signal on any one of them.  There was always static or hiss in the background.  I think this transmitter is just not powerful enough.  I tried placing it in several positions in my car as well.  I would not recommend this.  I have a friend who has the Monster Cable FM transmitter and charger.  He has not experienced the same problems

Or perhaps the big iPod Hi-Fi system could be dashboard mounted? :-

So far i've really enjoyed this thing. It works really well. I think the range depends largely on the radio you're using it on. In our van, you can take it to the back seat and get a perfectly clear signal, but on the reciever in my house it has to be sitting right on top to get any signal at all. I live in Arizona, and so far 102.9 has been the best for me.

I did not head the warnings from previous reviews.  The IPod Stereo Dock does not work with the 5th generation IPods (IPods with Video).  It freezes the Ipod or resets the Ipod, as well as scrambling the album covers.

If you have an older Ipod, it works fine.  But do not buy for the current generation 30/60GB Ipods.  Kensington sent me 2 replacements with the same problem.  They have no fix for the problem

Nice product works with all iPods including 5G and the latest nano. But with nano, there is no back support. So, you cant push the buttons on it without pushing it from the back. Well designed. Minimal or no noise. Bed side remote is the best part, if you like being put to sleep by your tunes. Docking Charger?? I am not sure about that because, as someone else also indicated in the reviews, if you leave any rechargable on the dock for long, kills the battery. Rechargables should not be left charging for ever. 
But the most misleading part is the usage of the word 'transmitter'. There is nothing being transmitted here!!! Or did I miss something? As a technologist, transmitting to me is something that is modulating and airing signal in the form of FM, AM, RF etc, to be received by an A/V Receiver and demodulated/amplified out into your speakers. Dont be under any impression that this device is doing that. They provide a RCA cable to wire it to an A/V Receiver. So it is a wired transmission. :-) 

Otherwise it looks neat. It is simple and worth may be $25.

Great sound quality, no noise at all.

Cons:
Does not work with iPod that has skin.
Does not sync with computer, but should not matter since your iPod comes with a sync cable.

Highly recommended (if you do not use skin for your iPod)

I bought this product about 6 months ago at my sister-in-law's recommendation.  I wish I'd purchased one sooner!  I chose this model because you don't have to hold it closed to seal - it has an easy locking "tab" you engage so you get the correct pressure every time. This particular package also included bag storage, and the ability to choose different settings and accessories that came with it.  I really appreciate that I can store a roll of bag material right in the machine.  I wish this model came with the handheld unit, but unfortunately it did not.  It did come with a couple of cannisters and a wide variety of bags plus a wonderful instruction video and cookbook. The only negative is that the "regular" Food Saver bags seem pretty expensive.  You're supposed to be able to reuse them, but if I've stored meat in them I question reusing them since we don't have a dishwasher to sterilize the bags.  I've found that I can use another brand of vacuum sealer bags to achieve an effective storage package at a lower cost for bags that I know I will throw away.  Buy one if you can!

I made a big mistake purchasing this item. Not only are you limited to barely a few frequencies to choose from, but the sound quality is terrible. I tried this item out in many different cars and I get the same results. The static at times is louder than the music. It's safe to say that this is not a good investment to make for your iPod

The Concept for this is a good idea, but the design is flawed. The first problem is that they provide only rear support; no front or side to side. The natural vibrations from a running car are side to side, so when you have the ipod basicly hanging in mid air it is going to vibrate. The more you drive and the faster you go the more it vibrates. Speed Bumps and pot-holes are also problems. Since the only thing holding the ipod in place is the USB-Dock connector, it shakes loose. It did take 2 months of constant use before this became a problem, and I have "Fixed" this problem with a rubberband. The second problem is that there are only 4 channels that this transmits on. In cities with FM Stations near all 4 channels, this is a problem. This can cause noise and bleedthrough from time to time. I do like the fact that you can plug it in the cigarette lighter for constant charging, and position the goose neck for easy access.  So, if you can live with rigging it up with a rubberband and occasional noise, go for it. If not, wait for a better design with more support, or buy a different FM transmitter

This FM Transmitter has a humming sound with or without music playing on it. The transmitter is weak. In a major city there is no chance of being able to hear you music.  I bought two of these. In a Jeep Grand Cherokee with a Sony head unit the radio won't even pick up the signal over those being broadcasted in the city.  In a Hyundai Elantra with a panasonic head unit the signal is being picked up but the humming sounds is too frustrating to listen to music over.  A friend of mine has a Monster series charger and transmitter. His sounds 1000x better. Don't waste your money on this. Spend the extra $20 and get a product you'll be happy with.

The machine works great when it works. Unfortunately, I have had two models that needed repair - sigh. The first time the print head died. The second time the cutter was defective. Brother needs to a better job on their quality control. Also, I agree with others about too much wasted tape - a real scam since you need their expensive tapes

It is obvious that Brother designed this labeler to waste tape.  I bought the labeler because I wanted to implement the Getting Things Done System.  I find the labeler useful but I am very annoyed that Brother made the labeler is such a way as to force people to buy as much of their tape as possible.  The reviewer Rick Galati is completely wrong.  There is always wasted tape no matter what adjustment you make and the wasted tape is usually substantial.  There is absolutely no way to prevent the labeller from wasting tape.  No matter what setting of the margins you use the labeler will always print out an margin on the left side.  There is a margin setting called "NONE" but even this prints out a sizable margin on the left side.  The worst thing though is that if you use the settings which reduce margins than you no longer have the text centered in the label.  Instead there will be a margin on the left side but no margin on the right side.  Thus you have to cut the tape in order to center the text which is a big hassle.  In fact I just use the labeler with the margin settings set to "FULL" because I don't want to bother having to cut the tape myself.  Brother could easily of made the labeller in such a way as to reduce the margins but they didn't.  I can only include that they did this on purpose to get people to buy more tape.  The tapes themselves are about 20 dollars

Before buying this phone, I read the reviews here.  They seem to fall into two categories:  It works fine vs. it is a piece of junk.  I concluded there is a quality control issue and decided to roll the dice and buy one.  For a home office, it happens to have exactly the features I want, including being able to turn one ringer complete off (the home line).  I bought one, plugged it in, and immediately realized I had wasted my time.  First, while on the phone, there is a persistent loud buzzing sound from the handset.  I asked the first person I called whether she heard it and she said yes.  Second, everyone with whom I've been on the phone today commented that my voice was distant-sounding.  Some also remarked that my voice was "tinny" or "metalic" sounding (maybe it is?).  I called AT&T and was told I must have a defective phone.  Obviously so.  But I'm not going to waste my time on another one

I don't know if I am more dissapointed in the phone or in me for buying it after reading the poor reviews here.   It rings. It gives you a dial tone for each line.  The speaker phone is decent, no complaints from the other end.    

IT has these neat little lights to indicate a "new call" for line one or line two.  So when you come home you can see if you had any calls at a glance.  One call, both lights end up coming on usually.   The Call History feature will allow you to scroll through recent calls for one line at a time or both.  Regardless of what line a call comes in on it will be listed twice, once with line 1, once with line two.   Quite irritating.   You can not tell if the call came in on Line 1 or line 2.   In a home office situation, it is nice to see what calls came into what line.   

I read the reviews,  figured "they" must not have the phone set up right.  The phone has to know what line the call comes in on right? HA!  I've tried every light configuation, callerID set up possible and it still behaves the same, dissapointing, way.   

Do yourself a favor and find another 2 line phone.

People have reported the Caller ID feature on this phone not working.  When I first got the phone, it didn't work for me either.  I discovered an interesting anomoly by trial & error that makes the phone work properly.

For people who subscribe to voicemail service, the phone has a COVM indicator light that flashes when new VoiceMail is present.  This light also comes on steady when Caller ID has new calls to display.  Through the programing menu (under the "Voice Message" section), this feature can be turned on/off independently for each line.

This programming option is controlling more than just the VoiceMail waiting (flashing) feature (despite what the Ops Manual indicates).  It is also controlling the Caller ID.  If this option is turned off for a particular line, the Caller ID will not work for that line.

I have Caller ID on both lines and I have VoiceMail only on line 2.  Therefore, I had the COVM Indicator (Voicemail indicator) for line 1 turned off.  CID worked fine on line 2, but not line 1.  To make CID work on Line 1, I had to turn on the COVM Indicator for line 1, even though I don't have voicemail on that line.  The phone functions properly now.

Despite this problem with the programming menu and the ops manual, I think this phone is great.  Haven't had it long, so time will tell

AT&T is one of the few manufacturers offering a reliable two-line desk telephone at a reasonable price. This phone is ideal for a small or home-based business or a home with two lines. 

Set-up has been improved over previous models such as the 972. The LCD display is easier to read and now has a selectable LED backlight. The angle of the display is a huge improvement over the impossible-to-see 972. 

Configuration is accomplished by following menus. Following the printed guide is the best way to step through all of the steps (and there are quite a few.) The 992 allows the user to select a priority line, so each time it is picked up, it will go to that particular line, unless it is in use, in which case it will automatically switch to the second line. 

The only difficulties are in programming the preset buttons. Because of the ability to assign multiple numbers to each button, setup is a bit tricky and requires help from the manual to get it right. This is the only annoying feature I found in set-up. Once set, however, this process becomes a memory. Menus become intuitive after a short leaning curve. 

The 992 offers mute, hold, conference calling and two-line caller ID. It is possible to dial from caller ID numbers and to store them in memory locations. One button "call history" allows the user to being up caller ID logs for one line or the other or both, combined. This is very convenient because the user does not have to walk through the two logs separately. 

Sound quality is a vast improvement over the 992 on both speakerphone and handset. It's really good. It's not tinny and there are no rattling sounds. They got it right. 

After reading other comments about problems with the backlight, I was prepared for flakiness in this area but have not experienced any. The backlight makes the display easy to read at all times. 

There are separate volume controls for the handset and speakerphone, using the same up and down buttons. The nicest feature I have found is variable settings for the ringer for each line. While line ringers are a bit too similar unless one listens closely, the volume can be set in steps rather than just hi/lo. This allows the ringer volume to be adjusted so that a business line rings louder than the residential line. 

A provision was made for a headset and the phone has an RJ12 jack for passing through one line or the other to a "data" port, answering machine, modem, etc. 

The phone is attractive, has an acceptable desktop footprint and soft rubber feet which keep it from "walking" around on the desk. A 9-volt battery (not included) backs up the memory, time settings, etc. 

The manual makes sense, is easy to follow and serves as a great setup guide for getting the phone configured easily and quickly. Overall quality is very good and when price point is considered, it is an excellent value. It looks and acts like a much more expensive phone and is a good business or two-line residential solution.

I purchased this phone yesterday and set it up without any issues.  I actually like it so much, I came online to see if there were any better prices so I could purchase them for other rooms in my house.  Like many others, the sell for me was of course the 2 line capabilities.  I doubt that this makes a difference but one of the lines is for my VoIP and the other is my existing analog line.  They are both wired through my existing house wiring.  I kept my old line because I am somewhat concerned about loss of service with the VoIP.  I have tested and retested this phone and have not so much have had even a minor issue with it.  The caller ID works perfect on both lines as do all the other features. It looks nice and totally serves the function I bought it for.  Who knows, maybe I'll be back in a week telling you how its become a door stop for me, but for now, I'm very happy with a relatively inexpensive solution.  (although I have decided to take the box out of the garbage after reading these reviews...just in case) :

Non-intutitive, inside out functionailty. Everything is there but nothing is logical -- even after using for months I have to hunt for redial, etc. And just try to dial the phone number on the caller display -- it's almost imorssible to guess which buttons to hit in which order. This is the third ATT phone of this sort that I have bought in the last two years (two for my father and one for me), and I would NEVER buy another. I gave them the benefit of the doubt the first two times I had problems, but three failed devices is a trend. Most recently, the LED simply failed, and the functions were made, if anything, LESS intuitive, to the point where they are now harder to use. If you have a few weeks to practice, practice, practice, and learn how to operate this phone (the redial button is on the left at the bottom of three rows of similar buttons, and is almost impossible to find), it may seem worth it. But then the LED will fail

I bought the model 992 because I need the 2 line capability. The phone does not register caller id on the second line. The phone has terrible handset sound. The phone doesn't like a quick dial. As of yesterday, it only works if I place it upside down!

I purchased the 992 to replace an older ATT business phone I had for 10 years because I needed the Called ID capability.  The phone looks good but the big complaint is that the speaker phone sounds very "tinny."  I ended up returning the phone and purchasing the more expensive 4-line model (ATT 974).  It has more features (many of which I really don't need) but, more importantly, the speaker phone is clear and vibrant.  I'd recommend the 974 instead of this model if you plan on using the speaker phone

hp makes great stuff that works like a charm with mac.  i have 2 other hp printers. the extra warranty purchase , in one case , came in handy, as one of the other 2 broke before the warranty expired. they gave me a new printer. that does not diminish hp quality as printers seem to wear out rather fast, according to eveyone i know. that also is a good reason to spend as little as possible on one. so, good choice, little buck

Bought this HP All in One Printer yesterday and today it would not install. First, the on and off switch remained on. Secondly, the printer cartridges motor would not move. So I called HP and they said they would send me another one. Waited on the phone for 45 minutes. Then, I hung up! Back to the store it goes, no more HP for me! This is the second HP Printer that I bought that was defective. However, the first one let me install it and at least it served me for 3 years! My advice to you: DO NOT BUY AN HP!!

Con:
1. Jams every 2-3 print jobs.  Requires a lot of time and TLC to keep it running.
2. Software incessantly hounds you to waste ink on unnecessary "alignment" pages, whether or not you've recently installed a new cartrige.

Pro:
1. Fast print speed, for the price, when it's working.  Unfortunately, this benefit is negated by #1 above.
2. Has never jammed due to paper misfeed.  The frequent jams don't waste paper, at least.

Bottom line:
This is not the upgrade I thought it would be from my old Lexmark cheapo.  I thought the HP brand assured me of higher quality and performance than Lexmark, so I was willing to pay a higher price for the HP.  Now I wish I had my old Lexmark back, and I'm sorry I wasted my money on the F340

When you buy a Legend or Vista Cx you get a screw in adapter for 
the back of your GPS so you don't have to replace the back cover. 
Attach the supplied bracket and then you can use this auto mount or 
the bicycle mount. Just don't use the back supplied with each of
these mounts since you don't need it

This bracket is simple, sturdy and compact. The suction cup actually exceeded my expectations in the fact that it has a clever lever to adhere it to the windshield..  Doesn't need to be moistened or such. I love the fact that it has two areas for angling.  I don't like that it can't swivel - would be nice to have that feature so that, let's say for instance, the passenger wanted to look at the GPS unit.  Again, it requires you replace the original rubber battery cover with a plastic one that allows the unit to click into the windshield unit.  Same one that comes with the handlebar accessory.  It is perfect for what I needed, to read it as I'm moving for Geocaching

I have always had Panasonic stereo equipment and when I decided to get a new receiver looked at this model.  The sound is amazing I am using it with a 100 W surround system.  Works great for TV, DVD and even with my iTunes wireless set-up.  The sound is so much better than the older system and there is an almost endless number of adjustments you can make to get the sound just right.  With my music classical, pop or vocals all sound great!  Recommended highl

THE GOOD NEWS.. IT HAS ENOUGH POWER TO BLOW THE WALLS DOWN OR HEAR ALL AT A WHISPER. I HAVE 7 SPEAKERS HOOKED TO IT AND IT IS GREAT. CRISP AND CLEAN. RIGHT AND LEFT FRONT AND CENTER JBL'S. REAR SURROUND RIGHT AND LEFT JBL'S AND A BIC CENTER. POLK POWERED 8 INCH SUB WOOFER. I SIMPLY RAN MY AUDIO OUT FROM THE TV TO THE RECEIVER SO VCR, DVD AND TV ARE AUTOMATICLY HOOKED UP TO THE RECEIVERS TV INPUT. THEN I USED A CD CHANGER AND EQUIALIZER HOOKED TO THE CD IN ON THE RECEIVER. THE RECEIVER IS COMPLETLY AUTOMATIC AND WILL ADJUST EACH SPEAKER AS YOU LIKE IT. THE BAD NEWS. THE INSTRUCTION BOOK IS VERY HARD TO UNDERSTAND. THE UNIT HAS WAY TOO MANY ADJUSTMENTS. TOO MANY SOUND VARIENTS TO FOOL WITH. IT WAS VERY HARD FOR ME TO LEARN HOW TO USE. THE AM FM RECEIVER PART WORKS VERY GOOD. ALL AUTOMATIC. THE TONE ADJUSTMENTS DO NOT REALLY DO MUCH. SO I USE THE TONE ADJUSTMENTS THROUGH THE TV FOR TV DVD AND VCR. THE EQUALIZER FOR CD. OVERALL I AM VERY SATISFIED WITH THE UNIT, ONCE I LEARNED HOW TO OPERATE IT. A FAR CRY FROM THE YAMAHA 16 YEAR OLD AMPLIFIER IT REPLACED. I WOULD DEFINETLY RECOMMEND THIS UNIT TO ALL. LIGHT WEIGHT,COMPACT AND THE PRICE WAS RIGHT WITH FREE SHIPPING. BUY IT.

I decided to try the Panasonic SA XR70S when my older amplifier finally blew.  I trust the Panasonic brand in general, and i love their video products--excellent quality for the price.  However, i was extremely disappointed in this product.

Pros--very nice design, lightweight, intuitive and easy to use, covers all the basics and generally works well.

Cons--the sound is inferior. (i personally 'hate' it!)  maybe i was pushing it to go with 100 watts per channel (lowest power i would try to drive my large Klipsch speakers), but the bass response is weak, and i felt like i was trying to drive a powerful speaker with a boom box.

Overall, not a BAD product and for some people and their speakers and other equipment, it is probably very good for the price.  i happen to like a FAT sound, warm and dynamic, and i was 'cheaping out' getting an amp not really rated for my speakers.  For others who also love that FAT sound, not too bright, not too warm, you may be disappointed in this product.

I give Amazon five stars for their easy returns and good customer service.  :-)

Lots of great inputs and outputs options (though I still have to figure out why I cannot make the Component video out work yet, and have not tried HDMI yet). Audio response is clean and neutral up to about 80 decibels. But...

Does not drive my Mirage speakers as efficiently as my 5+ year old 85 watt Yamaha RX-V receiver - that is, the speakers distort at much lower sound levels and do not sound as 'warm' (admittedly this is a nuance of Yamaha receivers that some people do not like). Also, the manual is not great - it could use a lot more detail. 

Bottom line - you can't beat it for value. If you don't need the HDMI pass-through definitely go for the 55 and save yourself 70 bucks (if you can find it). Also, this receiver may be more appropriate for small and medium rooms, as I expereienced some difficulty with playing loud volumes (did not sound great)

First, I won't attempt to give as comprehensize of a review as 	Eduardo gave.  I pretty much agree with EVERYTHING he said.  This system is really awesome, esp considering the price tag.  I'm REALLY impressed with the performance, sound clarity, features, functionality (HDMI, etc) at this price point.  I'm almost certain that you can't do better for under $300.  On that basis alone, this is easily worth 5 stars.

However I need to echo something Eduardo mentioned briefly, and expand on it a bit.  First, digital amplification sounds  little different that what you're probably used to hearing from analog amps.  Some folks hate digital, others love it.  But all opinions aside, you'd be wise to test this out with your speakers and the rest of your home theater system before you decide to buy (or be ready to send back to amazon if you don't like it).  For sure, this system doesn't sound that good when you pair it with certain speakers.  

I have a pair of Cerwin Vega VS120s, which are AWESOME speakers, but this amp just can't drive them properly.  The sound is just terrible.  So I put my VS120s back on my older stereo amp (120W/ch) and hooked up the rest of my home theater speakers to the Panny.  The rest of my speakers are lower power Cerwin Vegas (5" fronts, 4" surrounds/rears, 5" center, 100W subwoofer) and they sound just GRAND.  

I decided the best solution for me was to use the Panny for watching movies (on my lower power speakers) and use my old stereo amp for my higher power VS120s.  

I'm sure other folks will notice that this amp is overall an AWESOME value and a fantastic performer for $299, but you should also be ready to make sure you're not putting it into a home theater setup that it's just not well-suited to.

Otherwise, I'd recommend dropping the $299 on this, it's really an exceptional piece of equipment.  When did Panny learn to make good audio equipment, anyway?  ;

Here's a simple comparison of this model and the newer xr-55:

xr70: HDMI, 6.1 channels, binding posts only on 2 main channels and annoying spring clips on the rest, lowest crossover at 100Hz, $300-350

xr55: no HDMI, 7.1 channels, binding posts on all channels, lowest crossover at 80Hz, $230-250


In other words, the internal parts are basically identical between these two models.  The only reason to get the xr70 is to have HDMI, which only matters if your TV has an HDMI connection and so does your DVD player, cable/satellite box, etc.  Personally I find that a simple video component connection has about the same picture quality so this to me is a non-issue.


Here's my personal history with these Panasonic sa-xr55: I went from an Onkyo 601 to a Marantz 5400 then added some NAD separates for the mains. A few months later, I bought the Panny xr55 on a lark from Amazon thinking that I was just going to try it out and send it back, treating the $15 return shipping fee as a home audition fee.

Now my Marantz is headed to eBay and my NAD separates are running my bedroom system.

I'm not promising that you will have the same results but you really owe it to yourself to give it a listen, $15 is peanuts. I know that Panasonic is hardly a well-respected audiophile brand, but they and TI (the xr55 runs on a TI Equibit chip) have come out with a real paradigm shift in amplification technology, especially at this ridiculously low pricepoint.  

If you browse and search online audio discussion boards such as AVS Forums, eCoustics, and hometheaterforum dot com, or do a simple Google search for these models, you'll find a plethora of similar accounts of people giving up much, much more expensive receivers and amps in favor of these digital Panasonics.  

A few caveats---very minor IMHO at this pricepoint: no pre-outs (would negate the whole point of a digital amp after all), subwoofer crossover only down to 80Hz (only to 100Hz for the xr70), no room speaker EQ, primitive remote, no digital outputs, no OSD (onscreen display). Also may not be the best choice if you have lousy, overly bright speakers with tipped-up treble (JBLs, Cerwin Vegas, etc.)...neutral (e.g. Ascend Acoustics) and warm (e.g. Alegria Audio, Wharfedale) speakers do best with them.

Just as some folks still prefer LPs to CDs and tubes to solid state, you might decide to stick with an analog receiver, I'll make no guarantees.  But it's definitely worth hearing it to make up your own mind, in any case...it's a whole different animal!  

(I have written a much longer, more detailed Amazon review of the xr55.

I'm on my second pair of these headphones. Just don't get so immersed in the sound that you walk away from your computer forgetting to take the headset off. It's a true testament to the sound quality coming out of this device. The earpieces seal nicely over your ears immersing you in great sound. My wife has to creep up on me now to physically get my attention because I'm in my own little world. 

The microphone quality is just as good as the earphones. This headset is a perfect match for Skype. People I speak with on it can't tell the difference between it and a regular phone. The microphone does an excellent job isolating your voice and delivering a clear signal on the other end. 

I recently travelled with the headset with my laptop and a wireless connection. Needless to say it made communicating with others on the other side of the world very aforable and convenient. My only word of cation is to handle them with care when travelling. The earphones have a tendency to pop out in transit and the headset footprint isn't exactly small.

All in all I am very pleased with this headset / microphone. Even my two year old was impressed when I put them on him for a kid's show session

This is just OK. The sound quality is not superb. I use this with Skype and I don't have any issues with domestic calls, although the voice on the other end sounds more distant than a regular cheapy landline phone or cell phone. When I make international call with Skype, however, I often have problems with skipped voice etc. I guess it is more a problem with Skype system than with this headset. I listen to music with this headset and the sound quality is just OK not superb. I increase star rating to 4, because the price is reasonable.

I purchased this to use for recording my podcast, On Digital Media ([...]). I found that relying on the cpu of my MacBook introduced unbearable latency while monitoring the recording.

I purchased the iMic to offload the analog-to-digital encoding of the audio and reduce the latency, which was successful. 

However, I've found that this model tends to introduce some ground noise into the recording. It may be unique to my setup, but I did not experience ground noise using V1 of the iMic. (I've owned and used both.)

Overall, I would recommend this product for anyone looking for an inexpensive way to record audio on their Mac or PC

I got an iMic2 because I wanted to convert musics from my LPs and tapes to AAC/MP3 files, and my Mac Mini doesn't have an Audio-In port. It works great! It comes with adapter cables for RCA plugs, so no other equipment is needed to connect my turntable and cassette deck directly to my computer. I was a little worried that the built-in pre-amp wouldn't boost the turntable signal enough, but even that isn't a problem; the only adjustments I need to make when using the turntable as a source are to set the iMic2's input switch to "Mic" and crank my computer's audio input level all the way up. The software that comes with it, Final Vinyl (*for Macs only*), also works really well. I originally planned to use Roxio Spin Doctor to do my recording, but it freezes frequently for no apparent reason -- so that was a waste of money; I just use Final Vinyl instead. It's really simple to use, and the special EQ setting for LPs mimics the EQ circuit provided by a stereo amplifier's turntable input jack (without that, the turntable signal has a "tinny" sound -- but since that setting alone creates a kind of muffled effect, I like to add a second EQ setting on top of that, to boost the treble). I save the Final Vinyl AIFF files to my hard drive then import them into iTunes and convert them to AAC files there. They sound GREAT. What a nice surprise that my computer can do all this, with very satisfactory results, with just this little device and Griffin's free software

I tied recording directly from my turntable with no satisfactory result. My turntable has no preamplification. Swithced to recording out of the earphone jack of my main stereo preamp with absolutely wonderful results. Final Vinyl program is simplicity itself. EQ options permit you to overcome a lot of sortcomings of the original vinyl recording. Was able to reproduce such diverse things as Mazel's CSO record of Prokoviev's Romeo and Juliet and my old treasured Stan Kenton recordings with near CD quality. Well worth the cost and simple to use. Highly recommeded

The Apple Mac mini audio input jack is highly susceptible to picking up 60-cycle hum and other audio noise. I bought this device to get around the problem and found it introduces a high level of white noise to the audio signal. Not acceptable

I record a lot of vocals directly into my pc, and I thought that the iMic 2 may cancel out a significant amount of distortion since it connects to USB instead through the sound card.  I was right and wrong, if you try recording into your pc with the iMic set to mic level input, recording will still sound very distorted. But if you have it set to line level input practically all distortion is wiped out.  I am very pleased with how the iMic performs at such a low price.  Out put is pretty weak though

I go back a ways with Internet telephony. In the mid- to late-1990s, I used Net2Phone. Reception was always fuzzy and I remember buying several headsets that used separate plugs for the microphone and speaker that connected to jacks on the sound card. The voice quality with those cheap headsets was so bad that I finally broke down and bought an expensive USB headset. Only then, I was able make calls where the sound quality was tolerable.

But now, with the popularity of broadband, better soundcards, and more mature technology, Internet telephony has gotten to the point where the sound quality is often as good as landline telephone. I have become a big Skype fan, and I was looking for an inexpensive light-weight headset that I could keep in my laptop bag and not worry about it getting crushed. 

I had heard about the quality of Senneheiser headsets so I purchased the Sennheiser PC30 and hoped for the best. My wishes were answered. The noise-cancelling mic is crystal clear and voice sound quality from the headphones is excellent. Even my biggest critic, my mom, can't tell the difference from when I am using this headset or a regular telephone. They sound as good and in most cases better than any USB headset that I have used. They also fold up nicely and I can tuck them into a pocket in my laptop case.

My only complaint is the plastic headset and black foam padding around the ear muffs and microphone can feel cheap, but for the price, I can certainly live with it. If you are looking for a low-priced quality headset with noise cancelling that works great with Skype and performs better than many headsets that cost much more, the Sennheiser PC30 is the answer.

This is the latest update to National Geographic's excellent CD-ROM topo maps.  Since they are scanned versions of USGS paper topo maps, you get all the detail of the paper map but with all the advantages of software maps.  You can create waypoints and routes on the computer, then upload them to your GPS.  Or you can download waypoints and tracks from your GPS receiver and see them on the computer map.  You can create elevation profiles for your tracks, measure distances, and easily switch between different map datums or coordinate formats.  The only thing you can't do is load the maps themselves into your GPS receiver.  This latest edition finally is designed to work with USB receivers like the Garmin GPSMap 60-series.  This is a tremendous advantage compared to the previous editions.
   The main objection I have is that it isn't easily compatible with the previous edition.  In my case, I had the prior edition for Utah, and expected the Utah CDs to work with the new software.  But for some reason they don't.  So I have to leave the old edition installed for the Utah maps and the new one for California maps.  Fortunately I can download the Utah waypoints and tracks from my 60CS using the USB capability of the California software.  I then have to save the .tpo file, launch the old edition software and pull up the Utah map, then import the .tpo file.  Very inconvenient, but at least there is a way to make it work.  I guess they would prefer I buy a new edition of the Utah maps.
   The only other complaint I have is that they still haven't completely adopted Windows user interface conventions.  For example, there are no scroll bars on the side and bottom of the map to allow you to move the map on your screen.  You have to move your cursor to the edge of the map, watch for the cursor to change to an arrow, and hold down the mouse button.  The direction of scroll depends on exactly where on the screen your cursor is.  Another frustration is that there is no FILE menu, so I can't easily cut and paste data into other applications.  But these are relatively small concerns that you can quickly adapt to

This piece of software is what I have been hoping for for since I bought my machine. It is the most elegant and detailed mapping system that I have used. With the Garmin Vista Cx it works flawlessly. You can download any or all of the map data from the disks into the "Topo" file and it runs very well on my powerbook G4. It will upload all waypoints, and routes. It will download all waypoints, routes and tracks! The maps are gorgeous! The interactive web feature is cool but young. It has a geocaching feature. The 3d maps are sweet! It downloads updates and new map layers almost perfectly (had to manually download the software update). I only wish that waypoints symbols would transfer to and from my unit but I can easily live without them. Load the Mapsource maps to your device (Garmin "x" series saves to swappable memory microSD cards) and use Topo! from your laptop

I have not used this product extensively but it had proven to be very useful for my needs. I am very pleased with it and only have a couple of comments. It has an excellent search tool and has found almost every location that I have searched on, even some very little and very remote campgrounds. This is what I was mainly interested in as the other software's I have used are very (VERY) limited in this. The only two things that I have noticed is that it does have fixed zoom ratios and the wildlife areas that I am interested in are shaded dark grey when zoomed in which is somewhat maddening. They could have used a lighter grey as it is very hard to see the mapping in these shaded areas. That is the only reason I am dropping my rating down to a 4. This product is very user friendly and I would highly recommend it, so far it has been the best bang for the buck!. Digitizing the trails and creating profiles along with flyovers is as slick and easy as can be. The same goes with plotting GPS points from ASCII onto my TOPO maps or from them

I had to find a card, that would provide a strong enough signal, to solidify my connection, at a location on the fringe of a service area, and just outside of the range of standard cards.  The DWL-G550 came with an external antenna and ~10' of cable.  The connector on the back of the card is a standard SMA connector that allows you to use the Hawking high gain antenna for extended range.  I have used the 15dBi, 14dBi, and the 9dBi antennae with this card and have had great success with them.  I discovered that the antenna that D-Link supplied with this card works well with a clear line of sight for extended distances and does well in areas where there is an obstructed line of sight.  I have since purchased 5 more of these cards and will use the D-Link DWL-G550 whenever I have to go wireless with a desktop.  The drivers and software are excellent, providing a clear, easy-to-use interface.  It even works with NetStumbler, which makes monitoring WiFi conditions a breeze.

This adapter has served me very well.  It was a replacement for a Linksys USB 802.11B NIC.  
The D-Link fits into any free PCI slot, and it has an external antenna that is connected to the PCI card via a cable that is about 3' long - it would be nice if this was longer so that you have better placement options.  The antenna itself has a flat circular base, so it will stand upright on a flat surface.
I was amazed when I started using this NIC, many other Wireless LANS appeared when I scanned for networks (many of them unsecured!).  This gives me much better reception than my old Linksys.
One caveat is that if you are installing this in place of some other adapter, make sure you uninstall the older adapter software to avoid confusion

First off, look at what your buying.  A small compact speaker system.  Everyone has their own opinion but you have to be realistic.  This is NOT a replacement for your home stereo.  Yes, even a good pc speaker system with subwoofer might sound better but their not portable!  You have to keep in mind the size of this thing.  Small, very small.  Which is exactly what I wanted.  I wanted something small to set on my kitchen counter, but yet sound good.  This is perfect!  It only sticks out 4" when against the backsplash.  It's 13" long.  Sits nicely on the counter without taking up valuable space.  As far as the sound quality goes I was not expecting much from a small package.  Well, it suprised me.  Keep in mind it's size.  It sounds great!!!  Does it have the bass of a subwoofer system? No. Does it go really loud like my stereo? No.  But for it's size it has excellent sound and goes loud enough that I do not need to turn it up all the way.  At half volume you can have a conversation but at full volume your jammin on small scale.  Depending on the song, most of them I have play at full volume without distortion.  Most little speaker systems distort very quickly.  The built in batteries are a great feature.  I like to take it into the bathroom when I shower.  Not sure how long they will last, still to new.  I have played it for 4 hours so far without charging it.  The remote control is small and has basic functions. 
 
Bottom line...I am happy with my purchase!  For it's size it really does sound nice.  In fact it sounds better than I ever expected with such small drivers.  As far as price goes, it's better than spending $300 for the Bose system.  No, I'm not saying it sounds better than Bose!!  I just didn't want to fork out $300 for it, plus it's bigger

This is a well designed and manufactured product which lives up to its promise.  The sound from fairly small speakers is well balanced and rich with good detail and solid bass reproduction. It successfuly reproduces a wide range of music of different genres from an iPod and is easy to set up and use.  The fact that it can be charged from a wide variety of power sources both in the USA (110V AC 60 Hz) as well as in Europe (typically 240V 50Hz) is a particularly useful feature which was a deciding factor in my purchase as a UK resident.  This item is very good value for money

These are great speakers, they are a good alternative to the expensive Bose ipod speakers. They have good sound and decent base.  They are farely loud when you crank them all the way up, and it is a plus that they come with a remote. 

The only draw back is, during parties, when things get loud, the music gets drowned out. Also they aren't very loud outside where they have no walls to bounce the sound off of.

However, i am very please with this produc

These are a great addition to our system.  For one, I always know where to look for the ipod when I'm at home and secondly, it is charged and ready to go when I leave.  The sound is good for a system of its size and since we like to listen on shuffle, we can both listen to our entire music selection as we go about our business at home.  We've taken them on trips abroad as well.  I have already recommended them to friends and would do the same to you

Even If you don't own an Ipod(I do), this will turn your particular audio device(portable cd player...mp3 player) from a mediocre sound to a simply amazing, astonishing, marvelous sound. It is really like listening to it with headphones....maybe even better! Clean, Crisp, Tight sound. I have bose companion 2 speakers and can honestly say that the MM50's have a more enveloping sound. The bass isn't quite what the bose put out, but it is very tight and does sound very good. All in all, If you want truely great sounding portable speakers, these are definately at the top right now and the Amazon price makes it a no brainer

I bought this remote and hooked it up one evening. It worked okay, but it is picky about the line of sight.  However, the next morning I looked at my iPod and was horrified to see that it had discoloured the screen.  There was a yellow and purplish rainbow effect across the top of the screen and since it radiated from the sensor on the remote receiver it left no doubt that the DLO iDirect remote had caused the discolouration.  I was afraid that if I continued to use this remote probably after a week the screen would be completely black.  I called the manufacturer and they tried to pass off responsibility to the store that sold it to me.  So if you value your iPod, stay as far away from the DLO iDirect remote as possible.  This thing is dangerous

I was very disappointed with the Dlo remote control for my ipod.  What's the point of a remote when it has to be an inch away with a direct line to the senor?  I brought it back to the store and decided to give it another try with a different brand.  I got the Griffin AirClick which was a couple of dollars cheaper and you can point it wherever you want and the ipod responds

I bought this thinking that I would get a great remote for the price. WRONG!  Not only does it have to be line of site, you can be directly in front of it and it still won't work.  I would NOT recommend this remote.  A RF remote, any of them, would be money well spent compared to this cheap made

This is one of those times when a review can really save the people that come after.  One person can save the rest a great deal of annoyance and hassle.

This product is very cheaply made (white sticky paper is actually used in the contruction, I kid you not).  The one I purchased broke at a weak place at the base of where it attaches to the iPod.  It's actually a potential danger to your iPod, in my opinion.  The company will not stand by it at all.   Customer service at Digital Lifestyle Outfitters proved to be both a joke and waste of time.

It is very overpriced for what you receive.  It has poor range and must be in direct line of sight to work.  The device is not particularly responsive to it's own controls either.  Another obvious problem is that the tiny remote itself has no way to attach itself to anything so it's one second away from being easily mislaid.  The product is fairly bulky and not particularly attractive in real life, especially the part that attaches to the iPod.  It's really useless for most anything but while the iPod is sitting in the charger.

This was a MAJOR disappointment, a waste of money and certainly not worthy of my iPod.

I saw this ipod remote for $60 at Target and picked it up from Amazon for $35 instead.  It has the typical variety of functions- you can play, pause, skip ahead and back, and adjust the volume, as well as turn the power on or off.  You may find yourself wanting a "menu" button, but it's not there.  The remote also needs to be pointed directly at the sensor to work.  The good news is that the AV cable for your photo ipod works with this, which means you can hook your ipod up to a TV or projector and then return to the couch to run the slide presentation from across the room.  That alone makes it worth the money for me.

Prompt delivery from vendor & product is as described.

Previously purchased this product over one year ago but one of the handsets was lost so this unit was a purchased replacement.  

Very satisfied with previous unit and equally satisfied with this new unit.

Too bad VTech discontinued making this model as it remains my #1 choice of cordless speakerphones made by VTech or any other manufacturer.

I highly recommend the ip5825

We bought this phone to replace a very poor pair of DXI 986 phones from Uniden (see my review).  When choosing the Vtech, we also wanted to avoid purchasing from Uniden because of a couple of bad customer service experiences with them. 

So far, the pair of Vtech phones have performed extremely well for us.  No interference even when I'm using it right next to my computer and our wireless router.  The sound is fine both outgoing and incoming.  No problems with going out of range in our home (a good sized, but not huge house).  We've also had a good experience using the phones with the Plantronics M220C headset.  We do not have caller ID or a message box for our service, so I cannot comment on those features.

Finally, let me just mention that we have only had the phone for about a month, so it is too early for us to have experienced some of the battery problems that are noted by other reviewers.  If we begin to have problems with the batteries, I will post an update.

If the battery problems do not crop up, I highly recommend this phone.  It works very well and has great features for the price.

Worked fine for a few months, then started getting the "CHECK BATTERY" error intermittently on either handset.  Replaced the AAA NiMH batteries per vtech customer support's recommendation, and the problem went away for about a month then started happening again.  Sent it to vtech for replacement under warranty, and new set received uses a proprietary battery pack. Worked OK for 3 weeks, then the "CHECK BATTERY" error started AGAIN!  Sent the 2nd set back, and just got yet another replacement after 3 weeks wait.  Our 1 year warranty is over in about one week, so I'm guessing this 3rd set will wind up in the trash when (not if) it goes bad in a month or so.  It seems the numbskulls at vtech blamed the problems on the battery and switched from AAAs to a special battery pack.  However, I am certain the problem lies in the charging circuitry since we've seen the problem with both the old and the newer design handsets.  We will never buy another vtech phone again

I waited 6 months for the perfect FM transmitter to hit the market,and when Amazon began selling this I snatched it up. The sound it produces is of better quality than the radio stations in my car. No static, no problems, easy to use, small and not bulky whatsoever, this product is a definite must-have for anyone looking for an FM transmitter

The quality of the DVD is the worst I ever encountered; approximatey 20% turn into shiny coasters; the flaw where pixelation can be seen on the recorded surface as a discolored band. I don't think I will be getting Memorex products for a while.

As previous reviewers indicated, good basic DVD recorder.  I suggest a starter recorder to replace VHS; you could buy a combo VHS/DVD recorder to archive your VHS library, but (1) dubbing is real time (if a tape is 2 hours, it takes 2 hours to dub to DVD), and (2) most commercial VHS tapes are coded to prevent dubbing.

Thus, as a basic DVD recorder:
(1) Easy user interface menu system (not many options available).
(2) East to use menu to insert Titles to recorded material; be sure to allocate a separate time program for each show to have a separate title (don't string several off-the-programs together as 1 recording).
(3) Timer programing lacks options for MON-FRI and SAT-SUN; this means you must individually program each repeating show (for example, recording the Tonight Show w/ J Leno requires 5 individual slots --  very tedious and takes up 5 of 8 program slots).  My JVC DVD recorder has repeat functions (but user interface is very complicated).
(4) Using it as a 2nd recorder is OK if primary recorder is also DVD -R (I believe Panasonic uses +R, so not a good match).
(5) Box has drawing of input connections --  very nice.   Does NOT have HDMI or DVI output (for those who insist on digital Video input to their Large Screeens.  Primary output is Component.  Samsung is pushing HDMI digital output; their "upconverting" is a waste of money - - you can't improve on source material).
(6) For those with DV Video (digital tape), must dubb using S-Video (probably no degration of source DV tape) -  - no DV input (4 pin "mini" digital input -- my JVC has this).
(7) Relatively compact size (much shorter than a VHS); depth is reasonably shallow, but width is still wide bacause stylists want to give a substantial look).  Also very quiet while recording (has cooling fan).

This is a very basic DVD Recorder.  It doesn't have a ton of bells and wistles which is what makes it perfect for beginners.  The lack of DVD-ram is upsetting, considering the DR-W4 is only thirty more for many more features, but sometimes less features are nice, the simplicity makes it easy for my entire family to use.  You cannot access menu items when discs are finalizing/formatting/or even when shows are recording, which is unfortunate.  Otherwise, it is a great starter by a company that makes reliable products

I picked this machine up a few weeks ago, and am most impressed with the ease of operation.  Keep in mind it's a BASIC dvd recorder, single layer, dvd-r and dvd-rw, which is compatible with most players out there.  I purchased this for the sole purpose of transferring old VHS material onto dvd, and this machine does a great job of that.  And the low price of this machine makes it easy for anyone to make the move from VHS to dvd.  Finally, I'll be able to get rid of those boxes of tapes.  A real bargain

I have waited to fully test out this item to do my review.  I purchased this over a month ago and I am very pleased with it's performance.  The sound is clear incoming and outgoing.  I've not had one single customer say that they could not hear me.  Minor background noise is not heard by the caller.  I love having the choice of using the headband or on the ear style, they are both very comfortable.  I also like having the choice of a foam cover or the coushioned ear-piece.  This headset has performed perfectly and I would highly recommend it!!!!!

I purchased this phone for my customer service job at home.  It is so convenient.  It gives you the option for an over-the-head or over-the-ear headset, either left or right ear.  The headset is noise filtering which make for very clear calls.  The earpiece has a leather ear cushion with the optional foam cushion which is also included.  The calls are very clear and have little or no static whatsoever.  On the side of the phone unit, you have a volume and tone control to make your calls even clearer.  This phone also has a headset rest, which keeps the headset up off the desk, therefore, cutting down on the clutter.  I couldn't be happier with this phone.  I would definitely recommend this phone for heavy usage as well as customer service work

Minus: Feels a bit small.  Side buttons have a poor design; Too easy to click the wrong one(s). Too responsive; MUST use the included driver. Many other wierd problems (freeze's, ect.) may be related to use of my KVM switch, which they say you can NOT use with this mouse.  Will likely go back to my MS mouse

I initially bought this mouse for my boyfriend as a birthday present.  I read all of the reviews and this one seemed like the best one for the money, and thats exactly what this mouse is.  After using this mouse just a weekend, my boyfriend and i both fell in love with it.  (I've since bought one for myself) We had none of the problems other people have had with it, the buttons are easy to program and we've never had a problem with it not working.  This mouse is great for a variety of games, but we use it primarily on World of Warcraft and Counter Strike.  With both games this mouse is perfect. I highly recommend it

Overall, I agree with other's reviewer's comment, but so far I have not seen anyone having problem with the right mouse button. I constantly run into situation where the right mouse button is accidentally clicked, which brings up the property menu. In comparing with my Logitech mouse, I can rest both of my fingers on the mouse buttons without ever accidentally click on the button. The traditional mouse has more resistance than the Razer.

I like the simplicity of the design and of course the little nuiances you can tweak to your liking. This mouse is defintely design with gamer in mind, and that's where it shines the brightest. You will get incredible smoothness with this mouse in FPS. I don't think any other mouse will come close.

One other thing that many people may overlook, and that is Razer uses lazer tracking engine that is similar to the Logitech's MX Laser mouse. This also means the mouse works perfectly fine on smooth surfaces like a very polished book cover where the laser can track fine, minute imperfections on the surface much better than the old optic mouse.

If you are thinking about buying this purely for desktop/business purposes, than you are wasting your money, but if you are a gamer, even if only a casual gamer, it's worth the money and getting use to.

I'm a gamer. I used to use a wireless. This mouse is MUCH better. First off, the wireless mouse made it seem like the fps was a LOT lower. I got my Diamondback today, put it in... the game, when moving around, was SO much smoother. 

3/4 of the side buttons are easy for me to reach - the two on the left, and the farther one on the right.

I can move my mouse across the screen real fast without the aiming 'glitching out'. Not sure if it's common in wired mice, but it was a pain with the wireless

This mouse is great, quick response, on the fly sensitivity change, cool LED lighting, and 7 buttons.

That being said, If I could change it I would do a few things:
1. Be able to turn off the LED.
2. Make right side mouse buttons a little easier to reach

I purchased this cable through Amazon from A-1 Accessories - the packaging is the same as shown in the picture and the driver disk is a CD that has been printed using an ink jet printer.  The instructions were printed 8-1/2x11 paper - don't lose them because if you do, you are hosed - you must follow the instructions to the letter - no jumping ahead 'cause you know what you are doing. 

Nowhere on the driver CD, cable or the package does the word Nokia appear. The Nokia PC Suite off the web WILL NOT recognize this cable unless you install per the instructions and then upgrade PC Suite.

I was able to get this thing working, but I had all the planets had to be aligned.

Based on the description, I expected a Nokia OEM cable - that is not what I got

Don't be fooled. I purchased a knock-off Nokia CA-42 cable and it worked sometimes, didn't connect well, and the driver caused my computer to freeze.

I purchased an original Nokia cable and everything works perfectly (recongizes phone connect & disconnect, never falters, connects easily).

It's expensive and overpriced (what Nokia accessory isn't). For good functionality one really doesn't have a choice

This is a good cable; it is thick, so it's well insulated and well shelded. The gold plated connecters are good to have, because gold will not tarnish, so the connecters will always provide good contact.
I don't move my subwoofer a lot, so I can't say as to the plugs keeping thear grip. But, as far as sound quility; it does not seem to much better than a cheeper cable -- it's not in any way worse, eather

Great product. It is always better to buy the original canon ink tanks because I have try other brands and it not the same. I highly recommend this product. It may cost more, but it's worth it

This is a bargain package of the excellent genuine Canon products. My only frustration is that it doesn't contain (and they don't seem to offer a bulk pack with) the two "photo" formulations also required by many printers built for the CLI-8 inks

While the price was not outstanding, it is still cheaper than I could get it at retail.  Plus I didn't have to spend $2.25/gallon on gas driving to the office supply to get it.  I would purchase it again.  I am hesitant to purchase the refills and replace the chip on it.  The savings is huge, but I don't want the hassle or the potential damage to the printer

I use alot of this ink in my business so it is convenient to be able to buy the four together. I would be nice if ALL the inks(includingthe PGI-5BK) were packaged together. The price of printer ink has always been a bone of contention with me, but we are at the mercy of the printer manufacturers. With that said, the price on this four pack is not the worst especially with free shipping or Amazon Prime

I've discovered that the inconvenience may outweigh the few dollars saved by purchasing the combination pack.  My Cyan and Magenta cartridges lasted only 4 weeks and 6 weeks respectively while the others are still going.  Purchasing more combination packs would have resulted in a backlog of unused ink.  You might order the package now and then (I wish it included regular black ink), but given the staggered depletion of ink cartridges, it frequently makes more sense to order the single cartridge.  Moreover, the combination of Amazon's one-click ordering and no-postage Prime membershp makes it no less practical for the consumer to order individual cartridges as they expire (though I'm sure Amazon prefers to send out large quantities in the same order)

I bought the Home Kit for the RoadyXT. Overall, it does what you want it to do. You can either have it at work or home to listen to music all day. We have a firewall at work, so I can't listen to music over the net. That's where the Home Kit comes into play. The satellite signal it receives it not bad for being inside the building with no windows nearby. The FM Modulation is a bit weak and gives some static, although I'm not sure if it's the Roady or the Home Kit. Overall, the remote is easy to use and helpful on the road as well. I would recommend it if you want the extra item, but not a necessary one

Overall very good sound and comfortable to wear.

This is a new type, the sound can be heard by others, as it has a flow through speaker.  Our mind set is that headphones are for single listening, the others in the room can hear as well.  Though not loud, but they can make out what one is played through the head phone

I've owned the HD580s for 6 years now, and on the whole I've been disappointed with them.

These headphones are renowned for their flat frequency response. To my ears, these headphones deliver a sound that is empty and unnatural. These seem best suited as studio headphones. They might be good for hearing all frequencies evenly and fine-tuning a mix, but they are not enjoyable for listening to music recreationally.

I've had the opportunity to compare these directly against several other popular headphones. I've also tried the AKG 240S, Sony MDR-V600, Sony MDR-7506, and Ultrasone HFI-700. The Sennheiser HD580 is similar in tone to the Sony MDR-7506, but with less booming bass, which is a plus. But that's the only plus. Perhaps I'm not one for the extremely flat frequency response headphones.

On a side note, my favorite of the bunch was the Ultrasone HFI-700. If you don't like the Sony 7506's and Sennheiser HD580's, they're a completely different beast. I bought them and am happy with them.

Regarding durability, the paint on the headband has almost completely peeled/chipped off. There was no unusual abuse that caused this - just simple flexing of the headband when putting them on and taking them off.

Because of the open design, anybody else in the room will easily hear what you are listening to, even at moderately low volumes

I purchased my first-ever pair of Sennheiser headphones back in March of 1996. They were "Ovation 560 Mk.II" headphones which lasted me for a whopping 10 years time! They were the finest, cleanest, most accurate sounding cans I owned up to that time. They gave up the ghost just this past June; the right side went silent. Having seen a glowing review in Stereophile magazine for the HD-580 phones, I decided to order a dream pair of headphones through Amazon for a great price! You must experience these headphones if you truly appreciate hi-end quality! They are super clean, very detailed sounding, and they are very comfortable to wear during extended periods of time. The treble response is oh so clean, the midrange is just right (some may say slightly recessed, I say it's a characteristic of the Sennheiser Sound) and bass response goes down into the teens! You may even find these headphones frustrating because you will hear what you have and what you don't in terms of recording quality. Reference-quality sound, comfortable to wear, great price, and legendary Sennheiser quality! Very highly recommended

I got this about a few years ago. I heard this was one of the best headphones. This was true. Very comfortable wearing that I sometimes forgot that I was putting this on my head. The sound is precise, crispy, no coloration to the original sound. Especially recommended for classic and jazz music which has acoustic sound. And if you love movies, this works good for you.
If your AV amplifier has vertual surround output for headphone such as Dobly headphone or CSS headphone, you can enjoy listening to  vertual surrounding sound better than other typical surround headphones. If I watch seriuos movies at night, I always wear this phone and I could hear the voices well. I guess there are other headphones higher than this products but they cannot beat this in terms of compatability between price and great sound. High recommend for all musical and movie buffs

I've had these for years now and am impressed that they've held up so well considering some of the extra stress I've put them through. Very comfortable to wear, excellent sound. Listening with any other headphones now is frustrating when all you can hear is what's wrong them or what's missing.  Within the first couple of months I did have trouble with the cabling as the connections would not stay flush with the cans, but the replacement cable has never had the same issue. I think they still do well without an amplifier, but clearly expose the quality of whatever they're plugged into.
I plan on having a couple pairs in reserve just in case I ever have trouble finding more someday. Though you should use monitors for audio recording, the HD580's do very well in the studio too

These headphones are like being in a warm waterfall of sound. I listen mostly to jazz and classical and you hear the players taking breaths while blowing their horns. If there are better sounding headphones, I'm not interested because after years with my 580s they still send me and never disappoint. They create a precise, gorgeous aural world that you can just drift away in

Before I actually tell you how I like these, a hint to any frustrated users out there:  Having connection problems from the cable to the cans?  Try plugging them in.  Seriously.  This suggestion solves around 50% of problems people have with their computers, and I can virtually guarantee that it will solve your problems here.  The design is such that the cords can be plugged in mechanically well enough not to fall out, but not nearly well enough to be properly (electrically) plugged in.  In such a case you can push the connectors in quite a bit further, until they are well-recessed in their openings, and you won't get the crackling anymore.

Now for the review:

I've had these for years now.  Bought a pair in graduate school in the late 90s, complete with Sennheiser's DSP/amplifier unit (novelty item, but with shameful sound quality) for a very good price.  Since then, I've probably listened to them an average of 30 or so hours a week, mostly while at work.  A conservative estimate would put them over 10000 hours of use.  They never fatigue my ears, even after several hours of constant use, and remain comfortable on my head for as long as I listen.

The replaceable cable is a great thing, and when I managed to trash mine after the first five or six years of heavy usage, Sennheiser sent me a replacement for fifteen or twenty bucks.  Well worth it.  Dropping more money on aftermarket cable "upgrades" is absurd, of course.  If that's your bag, just spend the cable money on fancier headphones in the first place.

I also own the Grado SR60 and Etymotic ER6i, and of course neither of these really compare in terms of sound quality.  I've also spent some time listening to the Sennheiser HD600 and Grado RS2; the former isn't noticeably better (or even much different) and the latter just didn't really impress me, especially for the price.  Grados all sound artifical to me, although admittedly punchy.

Keep in mind that the HD580 has approximately zero noise isolation with its wide open design, and as others have noted, a crummy source like an iPod or most computer sound cards will have trouble driving it

I'm using these straight out of either my iPod or my Logitech X-230's satellite speakers.  Even with an unamped signal the sound from these headphones is just terrific!  Great dynamic range and very crisp sound.  They're also extremely comfortable both on the head and ears.

Soon I'll be purchasing a Headroom Total BitHead amp from Headphones.com to plug these in to.  I can hardly wait to hear what these cans will sound like then

I did a lot of research trying to find the best ones and i am very happy with the 580's.  It was down to these or the grado 125's and from what I understand they are both great.  The fact that the padding goes around your ear instead of resting on it makes them so comfortable!  Highly recommended, great quality...just gotta get a headphone amp now to make them even better :

The range on these things is terrible. I suggest putting the receiver up high with nothing blocking its path on any side to maximize the connection; this includes walls, cats, and furniture. That being said, the sound quality is absolutely great. It's like a surround system hooked directly to your brain. Some people complain about a hiss, but that only happens when you're going out of range

I am getting an additional set of the same unit for another TV location in the house. 

The specification of the unit is quite complete. With a wide range of supported surround sound formats from Dolby Digital to DTS II, running an optical cable from your DVD to the base will help enhance the viewing experience with some impressive surround effects and the base will indicate with surround sound format it is decoding when you put it on the digital mode. 

There is another set of RCA jacks for the connection from one other analog source i.e the cable box. This flexibility expands the unit's usefulness as I could also use it to watch TV at night and hear it without waking the whole house or keeping my wife awake. Now, because the base unit can support more that one headset, I could always grap the headset from the other location and share the movie or TV sound with my wife, still without waking the kids.  

I occasionally listen to CD's using the unit as well, and the handy "music" mode will produce a surround effect that is more suitable for just music.  I usually turn the surround off when I use it in this manner, and without going through the amp, I am getting a sound that is straight from the CD without any processing, i.e no adjusted bass or treble, etc, and the sound is quite good too. 

Go for it if you want a good set of surround sound headphones with flexibility to use it for non-movie listening.

these are very good headphones for movies,for music they are just ok.The 5.1 feature on these doesnt really impress me that much and you have to have to be in front of the transmitter or you will get a lot of hiss,but for cordless headphones there better than most for the money

I got the Sony MDR-DS3000 Infrared Wireless Digital Surround Headphones and an additional Sony headset for myself as a Father's Day gift in 2004 (from Crutchfield- Amanzon did not carry at that time). This is a long time ago for consumer electronics.

They continue to please. We have two sons less than 4 years old and my wife and I use them nightly to enjoy 24 and Lost and DVD's while our home remains quiet and boys slumber. It has altered our lifestyle (ever try enjoying 24 with close caption and volume on ultra-low? It sux goat balls)

Build quality and sound quality are excellent. Battery life is amazing- typically over 30 hours of use prior to recharging. Infrared tranmission is far superior to radio waves.

I will repeat if and when these need to be replaced

I've had these headphones for about 3 months and I love them.

I listen to music pretty much constantly while I'm working, and though I have some good speakers in my office, I find I focus better with headphones on.  I had gotten tired of wired headphones, as the wire always gets fouled up in the chair.

First, the sound quality is excellent.  It's not as good as high end speakers, but these headphones are a lot cheaper than high end speakers.  I own about 10 pairs of headphones (don't ask) and these are definitely the best.

In the office with these wireless headphones, I can get up from my chair and wander out of the room without taking off the headphones.  My office is about 14x14 ft, and the IR signal covers the entire room.  I have never had any drop-outs or other interference while in the office.  When I walk out of range, the headphones go silent with a slight hiss.

As other reviews have noted, there is a small quiet hiss when nothing is playing.  However, the solution to reduce the hiss is not to crank the volume on the headphones, and instead turn up the amplifier.  This works exceptionally well.  I have these plugged into the headphone jack of a basic $200 receiver.

The other wonderful thing about these headphones is that there is no on/off switch to manage.  Instead, the headphones turn off when the inner band of the headphones has no tension on it--in other words, they turn off when they are not sitting on your head.  The band is part of the "self-adjusting" feature, and it really works.  You just put the headphones over your head, pull the speakers to your ears, and the headphone band adjusts and the headphones power on.  This definitely helps with battery life.  I haven't really measured the life of the batteries other than to know I only have to charge every now and then.

Although the headphones contain electronics, batteries, and are somewhat large physically, my head does not get tired of them.  The earcups are fabric with some padding rather than leather, so my ears don't sweat nearly as much as they do with other leather earcups.  Very nice!

The set comes with an optical cable.  The back of the base has an optical input and two RCA plugs.  I use a 1/4"-to-two-RCA cable from Radio Shack to connect these to my receiver.  The base also has a magnet to assist when placing the headphones on the base for charging--the magnet pulls the earcup with the charge connection to exactly the right spot.

Overall, this product is awesome due to its exceptional engineering.  The headphones are expensive--no question--but they are worth the money.


P.S. Another reviewer noted that this product doesn't work with Plasma TVs.  I don't know anything about that, but that review made me worried if it would work in a room filled with LCDs--my office has many LCD monitors.  The good news is--they work fine.  Also, I can sit either facing the base station or facing directly opposite the base station and the signal continues to come in fine

Performs VERY WELL with no hiss or static.  Battery life was less than expected, but overnight charge and we're good to go.

Remember, if you are using optical cable for sound, to order "splitters" because you will need to split the signal between the input to your Home Theater system and these headphones, as most HT systems do NOT have an "output" for optical cable - - - only multiple INPUTs

Acoustically and ergonomically, the MDR-DS3000 is all that Sony claims it is. However, if you want additional headphones (MDR-IF3000) you will have to charge them one at a time on the base station, because no separate battery charger is available. With prolonged use and/or many headphones, juggling multiple headphones on one charger is sure to fail. If you need multiple headphones, perhaps a product line that provides extra battery chargers as well as extra headphones would be preferable

I just bought the Logitech QuickCam, and am VERY happy with it.  Delivery was rapid, and after hooking it up, with minimal trouble, I've had hours of pleasure from it.
 The only complaint I have is for lighting.  Not the Logitech fault, but it needs adaquate lighting to be used at night.  During the day, it's fantastic.  Audio and Visual is great.  With more lighting in my computer room it will be a 24 hour asset to me

I spent four hours installing and uninstalling the device. When I first installed it asked for five files from Windows 98se. Had to find the files either from the CD or Windows directory or stop the installation and search on the internet. Finally, finally, finally I got the thing to install but I had another problem. When I connected to the internet and tried to go to any website, IE6 would shut down and ask to restart. What garbage. So I had to uninstall all the software and drivers for the camera ( I am an experienced electronic technician and build computers at work and on the side) and still IE6 would not run. Finally, I had to boot to safe mode and run scanreg/restore and restore the registry from a previous date in order to get IE6 to run . I hope i can return this piece of garbage. OH, by the way. this is my first review of any kind on amazon.com. I hope this helps alot; When I googled for the files I was serching, alot of other people were having the same sort of problems. Thank you very much

I've personally verified this: this 256MB Memory Stick PRO Duo works in the Sony PSP as well as in the latest Sony digital cameras and camcorders.  It's very fast in speed and very reliable.  Just handle it with care as it's tiny and thin.

Now, in order to play copy-protected digital content you buy from Sony's Connect music store, you'll need to install the latest PSP firmware update.  The initial firmware (v1.00) did not support MagicGate digital rights management.

For ultimate performance and reliability when it comes to Memory Stick Duo cards, I recommend Sony.  There are too many reports of reliability issues with Sandisk cards

I posted a review two weeks ago, but it hasn't appeared, so I'm trying again...I bought this lock two years ago.  It has always been difficult to remove.  (Note:  despite what some other reviewers seem to think, it does NOT have a motion detector - that's a different lock.)  Recently, the lock decided to remain firmly inside my iBook, despite my efforts to remove it.  After a fruitless call to Targus's customer support, I finally got it out.  That took over 30 minutes of struggle.  My next step was going to be purchasing a hack saw.  Apparently, the Targus lock is not a good fit for iBooks.  I'm going to send mine back and demand compensation.  If you own an iBook, I strongly suggest you buy a lock made by someone other than Targus

I have been using this lock for a few months without changing the combination. Suddenly I could no longer open it as it appears that the lock has changed its combination by itself. 

I called engineering in the hotel I was staying in to help me. It took them less than a minute to cut the cable with ordinary pliers.

While I don't have any evidence to refute the package claim that it "attaches to any notebook",  once attached to my son's computer it was almost impossible to remove.  It took 10 minutes to get it off and we were pulling so hard I thought we would damage the computer.   We will be returning it.  Not recommended

I had been using the lock for my laptop for the past 4 months without any trouble. All of a sudden, today, as I went to pick up the lock, which had been left untouched in the open position overnight with my combination in it, it decided to change combinations by itself. So it was in the locked position but the combination is still the one I had set. I tried so many combinations 'around' mine but obviously there are so many different possibilites. The fact that I even have to try to think of what combination my lock decided to change itself to today makes this a lock I can't rely on

I am a student living in a dorm situation and so wanted some basic protection for my lap top computer.  I purchased the defcon cl because it was inexpensive, widely availible, and easy to use.  Unfortunately, it has one major drawback, occasionally it decides to change the number combinationss which unlock it.  I went to the company website and they suggested trying the numbers immediately around the combination and if that failed trying all the number combinations possible (there are 10,000).  Several hours, one blister, and 1787 combinations later, I got frustrated and used a jewelers saw to cut through the connection to my computer (this solution took only five minutes).  I would not suggest this lock to anyone who lacks the patience to try trial and error experimentation until they reach the correct combination, nor anyone attending a school with a metalsmithing program

This is the best lock you can find for laptops, but I am still not very confident with it. It looks flimpsy but better than others

This does exactly what it is supposed to do.  It is light, easy to pack, easy to use, and probably difficult to crack.  

(Though would-be PC pilferers haven't tried taking a hacksaw to my cable lock so I cannot comment as to its ability to withstand saws, blow-torches, or any other criminal's tool.)

Other reviewers baffled me as mine is as described by Amazon.  There is neither an alarm nor batteries.  Why bother with an alarm if the PC is locked with steel cable?  Seems like overkill

Handy and small and has great sound. I don't recommend using the option where it shuts off and saves time in between words/sounds bc it's sometimes not sensitive enough to them. The software it comes with is easy to use and though, I think there could be some improvements--for instance, allowing the player to be controlled using the keyboard and not just the mouse--I heartily recommend it

I have had this recorder for about 2 months now.  I use it to record my lecture hall class and it has worked very well for me.  I record it at the highest quality so the file size is about 30 MB for an hour lecture. It can only record about 2 hours at the highest quality but that works for me since I download it as soon as I get home and erase for the next class.  It records a WMV file but I can convert it to MP3 and play it on my IPod as I walk around campus.  The recorder does a very good job of picking up the teacher's voice.  I even try to stay quiet because I can hear myself whispering to my neighbor on the recording.  I would recommend this to anyone who doesn't want to drop $300 on a recorder but still wants quality recordings.  The battery life is pretty good but make sure to carry some extra triple A's with you.  That saved me once when the batteries died as soon as I turned it on in class.  I would also recommend when you get the recorder to not install the software that comes with it.  It has some DSS player in its software.  If you have XP then it will recognize the recorder as soon as you plug it in and you just need to open the folder to view the files.  Then just drag it over to whatever folder you want and convert it if you need an MP3.  You can find free MP3 converters over at snapfiles dot com.  That's about all the info I have and I hope this helps anyone interested in buying this product

Very good clarity of audio recordings.  I have used a Sony ICD-SX25 previously and the Olympus DS-2 is much more user friendly with a wide variety of good sounding compression rates.  I regularly email audio files back to the office and thus a small file size is crucial.  We bought 5 more for the office and everyone loves them.  The PC software is a little bit weak though, so I gave it 4 stars

Back in Aug 2006, I purchased a Olympus Digital Recorders DS-2 for recording in-depth interviews. So far it has worked great! They recorder is light and the sound quality of the recorder is pretty good despite the fact that I have been recording in places such as night clubs, bars, and streets where there is a lot of background noise. With the digital recorders, I am saving money on transcription cost. The digital files are easy to download and it can be done with or without the cradle provide with the recorder. For most part the instructions are clear but it is a bit misleading when they say it can hold up to 199 files because one can think that one can record 199 interviews - that is not the case. This recording capacity depends on the length of the files and the mode in which you choose to record (stereo HQ, SP, HQ, LP). Overall, I would high recommend this product.

I purchased this recorder for my husband after using an identical one for several months at work, where I am a writer/editor.  While I don't use all the bells and whistles available, I've found this recorder to be easy to use and dependable.  Downloading interviews to the computer is a snap, and the playback software is user friendly.  I don't know how I could be more satisfied with the recorder, although the instruction booklet isn't as  complete as it could be for non-techy people like me. I once had to call customer support for information and found the tech who answered to be knowledgeable and quite helpful.

This is a good recorder for the money. Sound quality is good and wma recording format keeps files small.

However, due to the lack of a noice cancellation feature, there is some ambient sound. I also own an Olympus DM-10 and the recording quality of that was much better, albeit, I had an addon mic attached. In my recordings with the DS-2, background noises in the lecture room such as chair movements, pencil scribbling, etc could be made out.

This is an excellent recorder for a student. But, if you need something very professional, I would recommend spending a bit more for some of the higher end Olympus recorders. I havent tried any others, but I do like my DM-10 a lot

I find this voice recorder very easy to use from a performance perspective.  Buttons are easy to use for those with limited hand dexterity.  Storage space is more than adequate, and the price is right.  Transcribing from recording to Dragon NaturallySpeaking works very well, but do not expect perfection.  The only disappointment is the length of battery life.  I am presently researching rechargeable batteries for this item

Like the other reviews claim, this product is blazingly simple to get operating.  It took me under 2 minutes to plug it into the wall, plug it into my laptop, turn on my laptop, plug all my other USBs in to and then become completely happy.  I've accumulated far too many USB devices for my two ports on the back of my laptop and have been very frustrated that I often couldn't use my mouse because I had to swap it for my microphone and webcam, external harddrive or flash drive.  Now, I'm content and quickly realizing I could have used even another four more ports..

Does what it's supposed to do. The power plug is a right-angled  angled one that gets in the way of the unit sitting flat UNLESS it's turned to the LEFT of the unit. Also, because the unit is so small/light, the 'weight' of the cables to the back lifts the front of the unit; double-sided tape or something sitting on top of the unit should fix that however.

Works well... Linksys/Cisco quality is evident in the look/feel/performance.

...plugged it in and it works flawlessly.  Some have complained about how close the ports are, I can see that, but if the box was larger, others would complain about that instead.  For me it is ideal.

Only issue I have is the L-shaped plug for the power, a straight in plug would have worked much better given the diminutive size of the hub

After reading reviews here on Amazon.com in my search for the right MMC 1 GB card for my Nokia 6230i, I decided to get the Kingston brand. Great choice, as it installed and works flawlessly. Great memory expansion for this phone - no fuss, no muss. I only wish they had a 4 - 8 GB version that worked as well, for the same price !!  I can keep dreaming, I know !!  Seriously, though - Kingston has always worked well for me, and this is another success with their products. Highly recommended.

I purchased this product soon after I bought my ipod.  Had even left the annoying shrink wrap on until I had a proper case...  The result? Two months of use and huge gouges in the face near the click wheel.  Even upon slipping the ipod into the case the first time some scratching occured across the click wheel.  The case fits much tighter on the lower half of the ipod with a gap between the face of the screen and the case.  Through normal use the occasional piece of sand/pocket [...] worked its way into the case.  Since there is no way to remove the ipod other than slipping it in and out I watched in horror as the scratches occurred in the process.

Other negatives:

-Case adds alot of width to the ipod
-Opening in bottom not sufficient for connection to Belkin auto adapter.

Solution:
Use the Apple supplied case..you're much better of

I read lots of steller reviews about this product about how the ipod is so protected inside etc. Well, this product is extremely heavy and made in ipod twice its size, and the belt clip kept breaking. what would happen is I'd be wearing my ipod on the belt clip and then there would go my ipod in the case on the floor while the belt clip was still attached to my pants. I guess, rhinoskin's protection did help my ipod with stand a few falls, but with a better case it wouldn't be an issue. I returned this product right afterwards

This case is a great investment to protect you delicate iPod.
It's so easy to use and provides excellent protection.
I don't have to worry about scratches on my video screen or any part of my iPod.

My iPod fits in snuggly but not so snug that you can't get it out easily.  Make the investment

I read the reviews on both this and the 60bg case before buying and was nearly frightened off.  Im glad I wasnt though for this is a lovely case.  

What I did do was to order a couple of adhesive plastic skins from bestskinsever.com to protect the face of the ipod in case it was scratched putting the ipod into the case.

I put both skins on - front and back - only to find that it wouldnt go in to the rhinoskin case!  So i trimmed the flaps that went up the side of the ipod and it slips out and in like a dream, adn I dont have to worry about the face being damaged.

If I was doing it again I dont think I'd put the rear skin on.

All that said - this is a great little case

This case is definitely the best case that I have ever seen for an ipod.  It's a little costly, but believe me, it is well worth it.  The case looks, feels, and is VERY strong, and the ipod doesn't slip at all when placed in it.  Also, every part of the ipod is covered and safe, including the precious color screen.  There is a hole to use the scroll wheel, and it doesn't feel weird or too deep.  It also comes with a belt clip should you want to be a dork and put your ipod on your belt.  I highly recommend this case to anyone who really wants to protect their all-too-scratchable 5g video 30 gig ipod

When I first started shopping around for a case, it seemed that Agent 18 had the monopoly on simple, minimalistic, hard cases. Then Rhino Skin finally released this aluminum case, and users finally have a viable alternative.

The description that amazon provides is pretty meager, but there honestly isn't much to talk about. This case doesn't do much, but it does what it's supposed to pretty well. 

It fits the ipod video very snugly, I was skeptical when I saw the cover has no top but try as I might the ipod doesn't budge even a fraction of an inch...pretty surprising. You also have access to all necessary controls, I haven't tried to dock it so I can't provide any feedback there.

I was hoping the inside would be completely neoprene lined, however Rhino Case only put neoprene in strategic areas...the result is that you cringe everytime you pull the unit in and out...however no damage results. 

The front cover is very clear and doesn't detract from picture quality, however my unit came with a couple scratches on the front...only noticeable under very bright light while the unit is off. 

At first I thought the belt clip was pretty flimsy, but it's been working really well so far. Also, that screw on the back is removable, so you won't be uncomfortable if you opt to not use the belt clip. 

The lanyard was a ridiculous inclusion...I have no idea who would use it, the ipod video is simply too bulky to be worn.

Finally, the cover definitely adds to the heft and weight of the ipod video, however this only makes me much more comfortable using my ipod outside of a completely cushioned room. I don't feel like I have an extremely fragile piece of equiptment in my pocket anymore, and I might even take it to the gym...others may not feel the same way. 

Overall, a solid case worth consideration, a bit cheaper than the Agent 18 (usually) with an aluminum back...I think users will be satisfied with either case.

Great Price so I snatched it up.  Mini DV's can be expensive so to get 10 for 25.00 was well worth it.  I have used these tapes before and got good picture quality so I have no complaints at all.

I bought these ear-buds after first trying the Shure E3Cs. While I thought the Shures had excellent sound, they were totally lacking the low end punch, which left them without depth. I'm a rock & roll listener, not hip hop or club music, so I'm not looking for extreme bass- just what it should be. The Shures did not deliver. 

But the UE have. They have excellent depth, and are just punchy enough at the low end. In all honesty, the Shures have better sound in some ways- better imaging, clarity and sharpness. But the UEs are very good in those ways, and have what the Shures were lacking. They are right-priced at the $170 level, not the $300+ level. 

Overall, I'm very pleased. And so far, I'm also pleased with the build quality, although I wish they had black wires instead of the clear. But this is a minor complaint.

There are plenty of lenghty reviews here. If you have a pod you owe it to the music to give these a try, and then try to stop listening! Good range, excellent clarity, and very good ambient noise reduction make these by far the best I have tried so far. Now i need to get a pair of 10s to demo. One can only imagine..

I found these on Amazon for 70 bucks more than I paid for the Shure E2C's so I took the bait.  They are definitely an upgrade from my Sure E2C's.  The sound is richer and more detailed in every area.  

My first pair actually broke around the first 2 weeks.  The earphones are designed to be replaceable in many parts, but when I went to tug on the earphone cable, it completely detached.  It looks like it's just glued on somehow, which isn't very secure.  However, Amazon promptly returned me a replacement.  I still have not received a refund for the return shipping though.  

One minor issue I have is with the grey foam ear tips.  They seem pretty flimsy and not as good as my orange one's from the Shure's.  They don't seem to last as long either but I could be wrong.  

I've read about a good number of complaints with these earphones in regards to the build quality and most everyone says those issues have been fixed in the new versions of the 'phone.  My new one's are holding up and sounding fine.            

The new SuperFi's just came out and I'm very interested in hearing those, as soon as the price becomes reasonable enough for me.

First of all, these blow away the standard earbuds that came with my Sandisk Sansa.  Instead of struggling to ear the words of my audio book on volume 9 (on a noisy train), I can clearly hear at volume 2 or 3.

Brookstone sells the Shure brand earphones.   I quickly compared my 5 Pros with the Shure E3c, E4c, and 500.  Overall, my 5 Pros sounded richer than the 3's and 4's and sounded about the same as the 500.

Some people have written that the bass on the 5 Pros is not that great.  You should note that the choice of ear cushion makes a huge difference on the bass response.  You have to make sure you try them all and use the one that fits best.

Like other people say, I've found the sound extremely clear.   These are more like studio monitors than disco speakers.   Nevertheless, if you want to crank up the bass on your player, these earphone will perform well.

They do a good job of filtering out background noise.  Noise cancelling headphones will do a better job on an airplane, but the 5 Pros work well in any environment, especially where the noise is random.

Yes, you do have to shove these in your ear, but I find them very comfortable.

A key feature is the "over the ear" wire.  It has three advantages over the Shure and Sennheiser designs:

1. Virtually eliminates the wire noise (the rubbing sound that travels up the wire when you move your head)

2. Prevents the earphone from getting yanked out of your ear when the wire accidently gets caught.

3. Allows you to park the earphones next to your ear when you want to hear or speak with someone.

The build quality of these is VERY SOLID.

Darn near perfect! (A comparison between UE Super.fi 5s and Shure E3s)

I received my UE Super.fi 5s about a week ago, and am pleased to report that they have proven everything they were built up to be.  Having used a pair of Shure E3s for the last year or so, and had been very pleased with them, I give the edge to the UE Super.fi 5s for the following reasons:

1.  Two drivers (UE) are better one (Shure) -- Common sense dictates that dual drivers (assuming they are quality drivers, which UE's most certainly are) have the ability to offer a richer, more nuanced sound than their single-driver counterparts.  Indeed, with the UEs, the highs are crisp and well-separated, making every string of the guitar and every key of the piano easily distinguised; conversely, the lows are rich and lush, yet never over-power the higher range.  With dual drivers, they lows and the mids/highs are delivered by their own means, and, as such, never overlap.  And while the Shure's are very good earphones -- and definitely the best single-driver earphones available today (particularly when compared to the Etymotic E6s, that are tinny and almost devoid of bass response) -- they simply cannot compete with UEs twin amatures.  

I performed an improvised side by side comparison, by hooking up both earphones to a spliter, then listening to the UEs in my left ear and the Shures in my right ear, and what I heard truly surprised me.  The Shures, which I loved for the last year, sounded fuzzy and muffled, while the UEs sounded vibrant and lush.  There truly was NO comparison -- the UEs flat out kicked the Shure E3s bee-hind!

2.  Efficiency, thy name is Ultimate Ears  --  With my E3s and a good clean seal on the earcaps, when outside in my hometown of New York City, I would have to turn the volume on my Sony NW-407 up to 22 or 23 (the max is 30) to get the full range of the earphones and adequately block out the ambient sound. (In NYC, one can never truly block out ALL the sound, nor would one want to...get squished by a bus, taxi or an oversized pedestrian in a hurry.)  With the UEs, I was very pleasantly surprised to attain the same level of volume with my Sony turned up to 13 or 14, sometimes less, depending on the bit-rate of the particular mp3.  It became instantly obvious that the UEs are far more efficient earphones, and will only become more so as I find the best possible seal from the earcaps.

3.  Size matters --  Here's where the E3s win a point: they fit more snugly and comfortably into the ear canal than do the somewhat oversized UEs.  It's not that the UEs are uncomfortable, it's just that the Shures are MORE comfortable.  I have yet to wear my new UEs for any extended period of time, so I cannot ably judge how long it takes before they start to irritate.  And, perhaps, they won't, for the flexible earloops on the UEs tend to hold the earphones in place better than the Shures, which have no such fixture.  As such, the UEs tend to remain firmly in place, and thus are less likely to rubs the inside of your ear, which is the major source of discomfort with in-the-ear monitors.

4.  Some miscellaneous points:  One thing that I did not like about my E3s was the cord was too long.  As a result, it tended to get tangled up or caught on my arm, or worse, caught on some thing you pass, and ripped from your ear.  Plus, the Shure's cord is thicker, and more noticeable when walking.  The UE's cord is a perfect length and perfect gauge, feeling light around your neck, and virtually unnoticable after you hit your stride....the Shure carrying case is actually preferable to the UEs shiny chrome case, in that the Shure case has a secure spindle to wrap up the cord, and the UE case does not......The variety of different earcaps is about the same, except the UEs came with a pair of double-flanged silicone cap in addition to its L/M/S silicone caps and one pair of foam caps; both the UEs and the Shures caps are well-made and you are bound to find a good fit among them....Both owner's manuals are informative and user-friendly...I have not had to call upon UE for customer service, though have read in many a place that they are friendly and helpful; I once called upon Shure, and they, too, were extremely accomodating (replacing the earphones after the left channel inexplicably died).

5.  Conclusion  -- Unless something signficant happens over the course of the warrany period (2 years for UEs), I have to give the nod, decidedly, to the UE Super.fi 5s over the Shure E3s, with the big swing coming in the Sound Department, where the UEs truly trounce their single-driver-ed cousins.  (I suspect, though, that the Shure E4s, which have dual-drivers, are an excellent pair of earphones, though the UEs beat them on cost (by about $15-$20, depending on where you shop), and carried the day.)  And, at the end of the day, it's ALL about the SOUND!

Hope this informs your decision.  Enjoy!

I've had mine for a couple of months now and I enjoy them immensely! The comment from another reviewer is correct, the UEs bring the stereo sound to each ear individually and ultimately meld it in the middle of your head, it's wonderful!
Once I place the UEs in my ears my hearing tunes to the output emanating from the UEs, all other "outside" sounds are either eliminated or defused depending on their intensity or abruptness . The selection of ear tips is a plus since everyone's ear opening is different, a choice for the best seal is definitely an interest in UEs commitment for the best sound satisfaction from their product. Their comfortable fit and wrap-around wire earloops allow them to be worn in most any situation or circumstance whether it be exercising, moving vigorously or resting vertically or prone.
The ease of storage, handiness and travel in my case is no more difficult than wrapping the wire umbilical around my NANO and packing it away or unplugging the phone jack and charging my NANO while keeping the wire wrapped around the middle of my unit.
The two minor "negative" things I have had happen with them is the wire loops sometimes get tangled up when I'm preparing to put them on or as I'm wearing them the dangling wire may have a tendency to snag onto something as I'm passing by it, so particularly in this situation I need to be more aware and perhaps wear them in a a different way. Despite these two trivial issues I hope to enjoy my UEs for many years to come

This is my first purchase of what I consider to be expensive headphones.  I definitely do not regret it.  It is well worth the money.  Grant it, as others have said, getting the right earpiece cover to fit perfectly is a chore.  However, once you find the perfect fit, it is wonderful.  You have to be careful because the noise-isolation works so well that even on a low volume setting, it's hard to hear what's going on around you.  You can still hear, but it is not the same as wearing the usual headphones that come with most mp3 players, walkmans, etc.  

I couldn't decide between these and the ones with the bass boost, but I listen to such a variety of music that I need the highs as well as the bass. The range is well covered, you won't regret it

Over the past 17 years of living in my home I have gone through quite a few different phones, since I originally purchasing the main Panasonic KX phone and 2 remote handsets all I have had to do is replace the batteries about every 18 months.  I can carry the phone outside and over to the neighbors 200 ft away from the base and still have good service.  I absolutely do not look forward to the day this system needs to be upgraded.  At this time I can only think of one reason other than physical damage to the base that this system would have to be replaced and that is when our BIG BROTHER ALL KNOWING GOVERNMENT decides to switch frequency usage.  Example as in the Digital TV industry.  Sometime in 2009 half of the TV's out there in homes will not get any signal (without adding a box which of course OUR GOVERNMENT will get a chunk of change from most all of us

The ONLY problem with this phone is the battery provided with it.  I own thee phones operating on one base station, and as soon as I bought the phones, replaced the batteries with Energizer ER-P511 Nickel Metal Hydride batteries, have had the batteries for two years, and they're still going strong.

The features of this phone are fabulous!  Especially the two line feature, and able to playback messages remotely.  Phone works like a charm.  Just replace the batteries as soon as you buy it.  It's worth it

I have this system in my house, and it is a tremendous convenience for me. With a 1940's era home, there are very few telephone jacks in the house, and having these plug in base stations where I need a phone are great. I don't have to spring for new wiring, have ugly cords draped everywhere, or wait for the phone company to come out to put in new jacks. I can move the satellite phones around based on my needs, like a guest staying over, working on projects in the garage, etc.  Yes, the batteries they ship with suck; I reordered a replacement GE Ni-Cad battery and have lots of talk and standby time now. I like being able to listen to messages on my base from the satellite phones. Amazon even provides you with a quick link for buying an Energizer $11 replacement battery! I do have an occasional call drop, but oddly this happens when I am closer to the base phone. This phone was not designed for commercial or business use, it is a home consumer product and should be judged as such

We puchased this unit for use in several small stores owned by the same company.  8 total phones/base stations were purchased, all new (not refurbished).

Of these original 8 phones, 4 of them had the battery go south within a few weeks.  The remaining 4 phones lasted a month before their batteries also went south.  By going south, I mean that you can charge the battery for as long as you like and it will die after a few minutes.  For a retail business, this is very bad.

To fix the problem, we have tried to replace the battery from Panasonic, but it is not even offered on their website, nor is the phone itself.

If the guaranteed battery failure isn't enough to deter you from this product, let me give you some other fun treats with this phone:

1. It drops calls.  Not just calls for the battery dying, but calls will just randomly drop.  You know it is bad when you have to tell customers to call back if the call drops.

2. The error tone is deafening, as it sounds in your ear.  It actually hurts when the low battery tone goes off or another problem causes it to chirp.  Ouch.

3. When you are on the phone and the call waiting tone sounds, it shuts the sound off on your conversation for a second or two.  Very annoying to need to repeat yourself or ask somebody else to repeat what they said every time another call comes in. (Basically, the phone shuts down for a second or two if you have another call and will continue to shut down each time the call waiting tone chirps during that conversation).

5. The range of the phone is laughable.  The 900 MHz we had before this had at least double or triple the range and never dropped calls.  Maybe I am being greedy in wanting a phone that has more than a 30-foot range, but it stinks when you decide to go 40-feet into the back room and your customer thinks you are hung up on them.

6. You cannot delete messages from a handset - you need to go to the base station to do that.  This wouldn't be a big deal if everything else hadn't already frustrated me about this phone.

7. Panasonic's customer service is not good.  Maybe it is the sheer volume of calls they must have received for this product, maybe we just called on three different days that were bad days for the reps, but they will not help you with this product for any reason.  We were told it was discontinued when we called the first time (2 weeks after we purchased it new)  It was being sold to electronics stores even when it was discontinued and not supported by Panasonic!


Bottom line: BUY ANY OTHER PHONE BEFORE PURCHASING THIS NIGHTMARE.


We spent over $1000 total for all our phones & base stations (supply lady's decision, not mine!) and have had problems from the start.  I have been unimpressed with Panasonic's products and customer service and would caution you to do more research and stay far away from this second-rate product.  

My wife and I have already avoided Panasonic products for our home because of the experience I have had at work with this Panasonic product.

Cheers, etc

Except for the unit's orginal Ni-Cad power supply, this is an excellent product. I knew what to expect as this was an addition to the system which I already had. You know, if you were to go to Panasonic for a replacement battery (as I have for my original unit), they would provide a Ni-H battery rather than the very unreliable Ni-Cad one. Therefore, I was rather surprised that the Ni-Cad one was still being used in the cordless phone wich I purchased. Furthermore, Amazon must have obviously been aware of that battery's deficiencies, because why else would they have strongly recommended the Energizer� ER-P511 Ni-H battery as accessory to the new cordless phone unit. I would have thought that Amazon, knowing the Ni-Cad was unsatisfactory, would have at least provided the Ni-H at something less than full price

Good:  Lightweight, compact, good design, clear sound, plastic ear buds
Bad:  wire weight pulls down and tends to pull one of the headphones out.
Ugly:  -

Sound:  Bass isn't all that (the speakers are teeny) but you get clear sound and they can get loud.  They do a decent job of blocking out noise around you.  Good buy

These are very comfortable to wear, and the sound is great.  I use them out jogging, and they stay put, without any pressure on the ear.  The tight fit blocks out any outside noise, so be careful around traffic, as you cannot hear cars.  I would highly recommend these to anyone

I decided to give these ear buds a shot.  I normally despise ear buds, but I recently started a corporate job where my over-the-ear set produced too much over-flow noise for a co-worker.  For a while, I tried to cope with the ear pain associated with the iPod ear buds, but it started driving me up the walls.

I was skeptical at first.  The sound quality sucked.  Essentially, I was thinking of returning them, but I came out here and read the reviews that say you need to get a seal on the ear piece in the ear canal for the sound to be good.

So, I mashed them into my ear canal, thinking that this was going to be horribly uncomfortable.  To my surprise, after about TWO minutes, I could barely feel them in the ear canal and additionally, there was no pressure in the bell of my ear either.  The seal was made and suddenly, there was BASS!  I mean, a lot of BASS for an ear bud.

I was pleasantly surprised at the sound quality once I got the seal.

Four out of Five stars because of the cord.  I hate the design of the cord, but I am hoping that I get used to it as I am still adjusting to tucking it under the collar of my shirt so I don't get cord noise when I turn my head

I got these headphones because of the reviewsm saying how great they were. Well, who ever thinks these headphones are great must out of their minds (no offense). These headphones have horrible sound quality, can hardly hear anything, they always fall out of my ears, even after i found the right earpiece. The slightest tug on the cord and they fall out. Also the behind the head cord thing is really a bugger. In my opinion these headphones are the worst [...] headphones i have ever purchased

Being a bit picky, I don't normally get something like this without being able to try it first, but I decided for the price, and based on the generally positive reviews here, I'd give them a try.  I didn't expect to have any problems with them other than fit.

Well, they fit just fine and were fairly comfortable for in-canal phones, but the sound quality was *atrocious*.  So bad, that I thought something had happened with my EQ settings.  The highs are so incredibly tinny, and there was a complete lack of lows.  (And yes, I did have them all the way in my ear.)  I even tried them with a variety of devices, desperate to like them, but they just sounded far too bad (and significantly worse than my standard iPod headphones, I played the same song with each, and they weren't even close).

They're attractive looking and fit well, but ultimately I want my music to sound good!  Or in this case bearable, these sounded so bad I didn't even want to listen to my favorite artists.  I'm going to try the Senns next, the Shures are too pricey for me

I bought these Ear Headphones primarily to use when running and biking at the club. The sound quality is acceptable, not exceptional. The construction is a little flimsy and the big issue is that the cord is shorter for the left ear than the right. That places all the force on the left side and that one tends to pull out. I have no idea why Sony thought that this was a good design. For the money they could also have included a case rather than a clip for the cord. I would give these a B- good/not great

Bought this to add more speakers to my system and it installed without problems and works just fine. Included software is simple, but works.  Bigger, better cards do more of course, but if you don't need more this is perfect for the job. And at about $25 is a bargain also..

Fairly good generic mount for my Treo 650, but not the most portable

I bought this unit to mount my Treo 650 while I am using my TomTom navigation system.  I like the fact that this set has both a windshield mount and a vent mount using the same sled.  My thought was that I could use the same set for both a permanent (windshield) mount in my car, and as a portable unit that I could take on the road.  

Well, the universal sled itself is fairly large and chunky.  This is not an issue at home, but it's not the most space-friendly when I'm traveling on business.  The vent mount works fine, but a better design for the hooks for the air vent would have been nice (you must manually put on and take off the hooks).  

The sled itself is adjustable, so this unit could be used with multiple devices.

Overall, this is a good value.  However, I'm now searching for a vent mount that can clip to the belt holder of my Treo case

I use this mount with an Ipaq 2755 in a Proprta crystal clear case  but it has enough adjustment capability for devices that are somewhat bigger through considerable smaller.  The suction cup is mechanically enhanced and holds with amazing grip.  So much that it can be difficult to remove from the windshield when you want to switch cars.  An easy fix for this is separate it from the windshield by slipping a credit card or similar flat plastic item between the suction cup and the window (after you release the mechanical suction amplifier).  This is a great bundle although I don't use the vent kit becuase I would have to separate the cradle portion from the windshield mount to use it with the vent mount (which is also not that easy to remove - not that difficult but not that easy...)  So this product would be better if it came with two cradles, which is the only reason I gave it 4 not 5 stars.  With outanother cradle, the vent mount for me is pretty useless. YMMV.  Also, eventhough I only gave it 4 out of 5 stars, I think its probably the best or one of the best mounts out there.  I have not seen one I would buy over this one (except they make kits with no vent mount - I'd but that over this one.

I did a lot of online research before buying this transmitter.  I had low expectations since it seemed like most of them have mediocre quality and problems of one kind or another especially in metro areas.  I decided on this one since this best met the criteria I had set for the purchase:
1. Good Reviews
2. Price at $50
3. Easily protable from one car to another
4. Wanted the passenger to be able to control it in addition to the driver.

This product more than exceeded my expectations.  The sound quality is awesome.  I have never had any difficulty finding at least one station where there is no interference.  Also, the protability and passenger use has really come in handy.  It is great to let the passenger control the tunes.

I would highly recommend this product if your needs are similar to mine

Worked well and sound quite acceptable. Would be good if they allowed "even number" FM stations - only odd number frequencies available but doesn't seem to be a serious problem. Also the dock connection could have been more like the standard Apple connector and would have more easily fit through my iPod case. However, these are minor reservations and overall I found this to be good value for the money

Recently we drove seven hours each way to a wedding. Our son brought along his ipod with his Monster transmitter. I did not know this product was available. What a great way to play the ipod! We all enjoyed listening to his collection of music. The sound was clear and very good. I don't remember any problems with the sound transmition except brief periods when we went across certain bridges, tunnels and mountain areas; times when one's radio would have difficulty transmitting also. I am definitely buying one of these for my husband for Christmas and for my daughter for her birthday

I have owned this iPod FM transmitter for about 11 months and have used it while driving thousands of miles through many FM radio markets.  In urban areas this unit is not useable, because, despite the availability of the three FM presets, you can't find open FM frequencies in urban areas, and if you do, the unit's FM modulator is not strong enough to overcome  adjacent channel interference from city FM radio powerhouses, and typical poor car stereo FM tuner performance (selectivity).  

If you live in the country this unit's FM performance is just fine, unless of course you regularly travel to a nearby urban area.  

Also, my unit "overdeviates"--the iPpod audio is distorted on loud passages when hooked up to my Dodge Durango with the factory stereo installed.  When the FM transmitter is hooked to my Subaru's top-of-the-line McIntosh stereo, the audio is good.  

I believe this product is overpriced, and should be sold with a caveat:  Not useable in and around major cities.

This Pocket PC is really good, I use it to do my powerpoint presentations, I can use pocket word, acrobat reader, pocket excel and pocket powerpoint. I can watch divx, mpeg, avi and wav movies, and hear my mp3's. I can even watch jpeg's at the same time, because it has multitask capabilities. It also has two card readers (SD and SD), so your capacity con go up to 12 GB in total. It wireless capabilities are very good also. You can find all kinds of cool software at low prices. Please note that you can just plug a little cable, and that cable to an external monitor/projector and voila!!, everything on the pocket pc screen will be seen in the projector. The processor speed will go down a little bit.
If you are a Pro, you need this, if you are a student, you need this too

Ok, the Axim is a great product.  It does everything I want it to do.  I needed it as an MP3 player for while I'm out on walks (trying to lose weight, but I get bored if I cant listen to anything so I have audio books) and I also use it to record my classes at the college I go to.  It will also play games while I'm bored an it also records my work schedule and I can put my homework assignments on there as tasks to remind me.  The only problem I had was with the company (Eagle Computers I think was its name, it was Eagle something).  I paid for 2 day shipping, and it did arrive in 2 days after shipping, but it took them a WEEK to ship it to me.  Now I did order it late night on Thurday, so I didnt expect it to ship out until Monday, but they didnt ship it until the FOLLOWING Thursday.  So if you buy one, which I would recommend, DONT buy it from the Eagle Computer Company

I use this as a substitute cell phone, using Skype. I don't use a headset just turn it upside down to talk and listen.  Works great with skypeIN and skypeOUT as long as you can find a open network, which means I have to pull over on the side of the road in any neighborhood.  Very fast compared to my original Axim.  
The screen is very nice.  Unit is pricy, but cpu flies and the built in wi-fi is a must!  So far I am impressed

One attribute not fully appreciated about this PDA is the screen. It is 640x480, as opposed to older models, such as the Dell Axim X30 (which I also own), which is 240x320. This makes a huge difference, not only for displaying photos, but also for surfing the web and writing notes. My X30 would crash when displaying the front page of the New York Times. Not so for the X51v (perhaps that is a difference between Windows Mobile 4 and 5). Writing notes free-hand was a bit crude on the X30. Not so for the X51v. Most of all, Photos are impressively richer and more detailed. Before my pictures were serviceable; now my photos look gorgeous, a feast for the eyes. 

I know of no other handheld device with a screen that has a resolution this high, not even the Palm LifeDrive (which is 320x480). One day, screens larger than 3.5 inches will have pixels this fine. When they do, it will be amazing. This handheld is worth it for the screen alone

I have to say that this is a truly usable PDA finally. Before WM5, the risk of data loss is totally rediculous and unworthy. Now with WM5, the ROM works as a harddrive and whala, no more data loss. 

However, it is EXTREMELY IMPORTANT that you update and fix the MS activesync problem before you can enjoy the solid-build X51. it is still unbelivable for me that Dell and Microsoft failed to fix this problem before shipping x51/x51v out to customers. The ROM update is not necessary. Simple set activesync to be manually lauched instead of the default automatic update. All the problems with battery drain, CF card missing and white screen of death just disappeared. With my casual use, a fully charged battery lasts over a week. I use it as my digital diary, calculator, game console, dictionary, media/file portable storage, and lot more. Absolute worth every penny of it. However, one flaw is that the bluetooth stack does not work with wireless headphones (any tips?). Otherwise, it can also be dubbed as a wireless phone/MP3 player.

I owened this unit for almost a year and now I regret I did not choose the wifi and vga version (x51v). I only had to replace the battery last month after almost one year of use, which maybe due to my constant recharge eveytime I sync with my PC. Now I am thinking about getting the extra wifi card so I can use it as a wifi phone with Skype. Better yet, now there are third-party larger capacity batteries available and I found one 1800 mah battery that can fit with Dell's leather case. Perfect!

Overall this is a perfect unit, and I would recommend everyone to get x51v instead of x51. The extra money is definitely worth it.

Update:
I called Dell today and just realized that the battery is still under waranty, but they want me to return the old one. So remeber to keep the bad battery otherwise you might need to pay for it! Another annoyance was that it kept warning me that the battery latch was open and the pda needs to be turned off to keep data safe. I found a fix on Aximsite. Just put a tiny drop of nail polish to the small button on the left hole for the pins on the battery cover. This will increase the thickness of the button and kept it firmly pushed down by the cover pins.

This is a neat unit, purch from Dell 11/05, with the Blue tooth Keyboard. Great display. I installed a SD card. Only problem is the battery life, the thing goes dead in a day or so when on the shelf. Then it has the "white screen" thing, do a soft reset, and back to normal operation. Might get a bigger bat. BUT--I have a PALM Z22 for etcetera, the battery seems to last FOREVER. ADVICE!! take a pass on the PDA thing and get a Palm Z22 for every day notes and little stuff.

I recently purchased this PDA directly from Dell after reading reviews and spending hours comparing different types of PDA's on the market. Most of the reviews I read were positive with a few negative. Regardless, I decided that the Axim was the most powerful, had more options, and was what I wanted. The screen clarity is amazing. I haven't had the battery problems some other owners have had. I charged mine for 8+ hours when it arrived as recommended by Dell. The internal WiFi is excellent, but I suggest purchasing the WiFi companion software. The range is great for picking up WiFi access points. 
Pro's: Great features, packed with almost anything you can think of. You can even buy the GPS accessory and turn it into a Vehicle GPS. Great sound and recording quality with the microphone. Excellent screen resolution. Comes with Word and Excel, which is nice to have on the go. 

Cons: Expensive, battery charges relatively quickly, but doesn't last as long as other PDA's. It does however have options within the OS to increase battery life, and I recommend the travel charger so it can be charged in the car

This is by far a superior machine to all others out there... If you are familiar with previous PocketPCs than you know what it is to loose all your applications and data because of a full battery drain, and then having to restore from activsync backup which could take hours. Well, the Axim x51v is a giant step forward with the applications and data storage being permanent, even with a total battery drain.  This in itself make the machine awesome.  I have never had any of the problems anyone else has had on these reviews... (I did the activsync fix right out of the box.) It took a few tries to get bluetooth to work but it now works great.  Works fast, clear and bright screen, easy use, permanent memory, etc... If you read a bad review, in my opinion, they are just nitpicking. Awesome machine!!

I actually bought this item as a temporary case the day I bought my Palm Z22 because it was the only one the store had for this model. I ended up really liking it though so now its the case I use everyday. Many people wrote hard to open and get open but its not hard at all. As far as getting the Palm out since the stylus and charge/sync plug is accessible while the palm is in it there is really no reason to take it out (which isn't too difficult if you wanted to anyway). I just gently flip the cover up and use it while it stays in there. Definately a great case. Even if it gets scratched which mine hasn't yet you flip the cover up so it doesnt matter.

This case looks very good on the outside. In fact you can't really see it! It protects the Z22 very well and prevents scratches. the case gets scratched itself though. So you might want to put a screen protector on it too to keep it looking nice

I found that when I applied a screen cover on the low-res screen of my Z22, grafitti writing was less responsive and accurate than with no cover, but I knew from owning previous PDA's that I wanted screen protection of some kind, so I ordered an air case. However, as I ordered it, I read all the reviews about how the case could be easily scratched. When the air case arrived, I put one of the screen protectors that came with my Z22 on the OUTSIDE of the air case. It fit quite nicely without trimming, and I am able to carry the Z22 in the air case in my front pants pocket without getting scratches on the air case or the Z22 screen. True, I do have to flip up the air case cover to use the Z22 including writing any grafitti, but this is a small concession in order to get a responsive screen but still protect it on this economical unit

I purchased the air case at the same time as I purchased my Z22, 9 months ago.  I love it.  I think it does a great job of protecting the Z22.  I don't think a case could be designed to fully protect the Z22 like this does and at the same time allow full access to the screen and buttons.  You have to chose which you want - protection or quick access to the screen / buttons. 

The cover gets scratched as others state here.  But you can still read the alarm messages through the cover.  After you get used to it, it is very easy to open the cover. 
  
This week, the hinge broke on my air case.  One day my Z22 fell off the desk onto the carpeted floor and the cover came off.  I didn't think the hinge was actually broke until today.  Now the cover is hanging on by just the one side of the hinge.

Despite the hinge breaking, I plan on buying another air case to replace this one

I've had this case for 8 months now and have found that it protects my Z22 very well.  The case has become slightly scuffed from being bumped in my purse, but it still looks good and I can only imagine what the palm pilot would look like without the case's protection.  Instead, my palm pilot still looks like new when I open the case and the screen is in perfect condition.

Opening the case can be a little tricky.  One handed, it's nearly impossible.  The problem isn't with the case closing too tightly, you just have to use your fingernail and twist gently to pry it open.  For future versions, it would be a good idea for the Palm company to put a tab or small latch on it to give you something to grip.  This is the only reason I give the case 4 stars instead of 5.  I still highly recommend this case to protect your devise

Playing GT4 with the controller is fun, playing it with the wheel takes the game to a whole new level. This wheel in particular is very nice, and the force feedback works great. 

Make sure you have a good setup to put it on though, it hooks onto a table, which can be inconvenient and difficult. I have it set up with a TV tray in a very uncomfortable position, and have since demolished the tray.

The wheel is completely worth it, the only drawback is needing a good setup, and that is not a flaw in the wheels design, it just makes it interesting figuring out the best setup

...was to mount the wheel onto a full size ironing board of all things!  It's height adjustable and relatively stable.  Plus, positioning the crossing support bars slightly to the right allows the pedals to be placed under your right foot while still leaving enough room for your right leg.

My only real complaints about the product are:

1) Setup and storage is a pain.
2) The pedals feel somewhat flimsy

If you are looking for THE PS2 Wheel, this is the One!
It's not just perfect, it's amazing!
PS2 racing games: GT4, Formula One 2005, Nascar 2006, etc become very realistics when you use this wheel.
The force feedback works great.

All the others are just things-that-turns-left-and-right, when 
compared to this one 1 and 1/2 turn.
GT4 goes to another dimension when PS2 Driving Force Gran Turismo is in action.

PERFECT!

The seller must be congratulated also, because it arrived in time and in perfect conditions! 
Don't even mind the price. JUST PAY IT! you'll be rewarded..

Logitech has made a great quality wheel that makes all PS2 games that are compatible with it a great experience; however, the older games will not work with it, not even on the 180 degree mode. The best game I have with it is GT4; It makes for very realistic driving

Bought this about a year ago and it is still woring without any problems with the endless hours of usage with GT4. The 200 degree angle setup is perfect and fun when playing Formula One as well. I see people complain about the stifness in the wheel which actually adds to some of the realism of racing, taking corners at high speeds. Highly recommended

I am very pleased with this wheel. It is the ultimate in realistic feedback. It hads vibration that simulates bumps and hitting curbs and others cars etc. I rate this wheel #1 . The only thing is you need to clamp it to a table, something solid. otherwise you will just be fighting the force feedback in the wheel instead of sterring the car.
Has many extra buttons for options in games. And the shifter is great. It even has paddle shifters on the back of the wheel like a indy car. It's got my vote. I use it with grand torismo 4

I purchased this wheel mainly for the 900 degrees of rotation. I don't like the button shifter instead of paddle shifters. The sequential shifter is fine tho. The wheel is great, love the 900degrees, espically for drifting, takes it up to a whole new level. It's a bit noisier than my old momo race, and feels about the same, maye a bit better force feedback. The wheel itself tho is much smaller in diameter and feels flimsier than my momo force wheel. When you really get into it you can flex the wheel around a bit. The mounting system is a bit weaker than my momo race, and dosent allow for as thick a table as the momo force, but feels great otherwise. Buttons on the wheel are fine, I am using this unit for the PC however, but no big deal. On that note, works absolutley perfect for the PC, even tho they dont really say so. The pedals are good, just like my momo race really, no real complaints. 
My laptimes are a bit slower with the new wheel, but it is a much more realistic experience. 

All in all, glad I purchased this wheel, amazon had the best price including shipping. Its taken my racing level down a notch slightly, but raised my enjoyment significantly. Put paddle shifters on it, make the wheel a bit bigger and thicker, and it would be a 5 star review, and the perfect wheel

A great inexpensive way to get the most out of powerstrips and multiple plug outlets not designed to accommodate blocky transformers.  Long enough to be useful but not so long that they add to the tangle of power cords that any modern electronics user knows too well.  Excellent product and very quick delivery

Power strip liberators are one of the best ideas in the last 20 years, period.  Unless you live in a house (or work in an office) designed by computer geeks and built in the last 10 minutes, you simply do not have enough power outlets for all of the devices you use.  This means that you have to use power strips.  It also means that the transformers necessary to run most of your portable devices take up 2 or 3 outlets on the powerstrip so now you are running a strip or 2 off of your first strip.  Enter the liberator.

This simple little extension cord plugs into the power strip and has a plug on the other end for your transformer. Now, you have 6  devices plugged into a 6 outlet power strip, not 2 or 3.  Simple idea. One that works.  Get these.  Your significant other will appreciate the neater workspace

The slow speeds the other reviewer is getting was probably because he was using it with a slow USB 1.1 port. On my system with USB 2.0, I copied a 630MB file in under 50secs. And I never "lost" any files during any transfers.

The reason this did not get 5 stars from me is that the shell coating on the drive is soft/med plastic, which is the worst kind as it scratches and dents easily. After 5 months of using it the button that clicks it in and out has become loose/stuck. Sometimes I have to turn the unit around and jiggle the button to get it to working again. Not a big deal, but I'm trying to get it replaced by Memorex. While it does have a lanyard and it is POSSIBLE to fit in on a keychain, it's not very keychain friendly. While not huge, the size is on the larger side.

Would I buy it again?: Maybe
The reason I say this is because other comparable models are not up to the task either. Seems like the newer generation of super fast flash drives are not very good. The Lexar Lightning has the USB connector breaking off. The Sandisk Titanium dies randomly. With this in mind, make sure to backup your flash drives on HD. I have outgrown it, but if you don't need the fast speeds, check out the Sandisk Cruzer Micro, that one is compact, very well designed and virtually indestructible

You may want to stay away from this product. Memorex claims write speeds of 15MB/s, but when I transferred/copied 600 MB of data to the flash drive, it took 35 MINUTES, instead of about 40 seconds. Also, many files were, to my amazement, "lost" in the transfer/copying process (i.e. simply did not copy). So the drive is not only much slower than claimed, but also unreliable.

PS: The other reviewer suggests that the slow speeds were due to a 1.1 USB port. That is incorrect. My computers have the USB 2.0 ports. The problem was the flash drive, not my systems

this case is absolutely great....the only reason i gave it a four is because if you were to use it in your car...after a long period of time it would wear out....i would suggest buying this item because once i get this case full Im going to purchase another one.....dont hesitate to buy this item....if someone gave it a negative review...just ignore it...buy this case with extreme buying confidence

I ordered this along with the Velocity Nylon 600D CD Wallet (320 capacity, Black). It is a very nice storage wallet for your CD/DVD collection. It is not as sturdy and durable as a CaseLogic, but a very good wallet for the price.

Pros:
-Large Capacity to store all your CD/DVDs
-CD sleeves feel as soft as microfiber, so that your CD/DVDs collection won't scratch as much as cheaper CD/DVD wallets.
-Handle on the spine of the binder for easy carrying.

Cons:
-The outside shell seems to be made of some durable cardboard behind the black canvas but feels a bit cheap if it is ever wet.
-If opened completely, the zipper extends beyond the wallet for about an inch or two. You must pull the tab out to get the two parts of the zipper aligned, in order to zip. Tedious and cumbersome when you are on the go. (Compared to CaseLogics, it's not as easy as just zipping it up without having to align the two zippers together).
-Zipper tab sticks out of the case about an inch or two and feels a bit cheap, and could possibly get caught or ripped.
-Sleeves in wallet are not removable like other CD/DVD wallets.

Cons (when comparing to the Velocity Nylon 600 CD Wallet (320 capacity, Black)):
-No top plastic sleeve/flap to hold each CD/DVD in it's slot, like the Velocity Nylon 600D CD Wallet (320 capacity, Black).
-No adjustable handle on the binder of the CD/DVD wallet, to fit different sized hands. The 320 capacity wallet is adjustable so that it can be made tight or loose

I've been using the Sony MDX earbuds for about 3 years now. The primary use is with a San Disk MP3. Used this system for jogging and motorcycle riding. Until purchasing the Sennheiser's I thought the sound with the Sony's was ok. However, the Sony's wires are soft-coated and after a wind beating by riding the motorcycle, the coating desenigrated, leaving bare wires. I went through two pairs of the MDX and decided to try something else. Enter the Sennheiser's. Wow... what a difference in sound quality. These little babies have great base and more importantly, separation.. yes, I know this is the MP3, but, I never got it with the Sony's. Very happy with the Sennheiser CX300's... will buy a pair for my wife

I never really ever bought any earphones that cost more than $20 before, so I can't compare it to anything in its class. What I can say is, that the sound coming out of these earbuds is amazing, and the noise cancellation actually works (almost perfectly). Amazing earbuds, and am glad I bought them

All insulated earphones sound unnatural because they seal off the ear outside air, so the sound quality isn't as great.  Other than that, these are fine.  The purpose for these is for the sound isolation and it does that well.  If you're into sound quality, get the Koss Portapros which are complete open-eared so there is no sound isolation at all, but sound great because they're like speakers on your ears

I haven't seen a review yet that really compared options among various wireless adapters so I thought I'd give it a try.
I live in an apartment complex with concrete walls that barely allow for a cell phone signal.  The little bit I use the internet I didn't want to pay 60$/month so I bought a Linksys WUSB54G Wireless-G USB Adapter, Netgear WG511 Wireless 802.11g PC Card, and a Hawking WIRELESS G USB NETWORK ADAPTER w. Hi Gain 6db Antenna basically just to make sure I got one that would work.  
The worst of the 3 was the Linksys usb adapter.  It could pick up weaker signals without having to balance the laptop at a weird angle out the window, but the software which runs it doesn't like weak signals so anything under 50% keeps the thing scanning even after you're connected. which means constant disconnects unless you manually stop the scanner while connected.  Even then, it had a frustrating habit of losing the connection. 

The Netgear card was much better at holding a signal, although it did require a balancing act and careful angling to get the signal.  The software was great.  The biggest complaint I had with this is I was dealing with really low signals which slow the internet to a crawl.  It would take a few minutes to load yahoo.  With better signals the card would be great.

The Hawking usb adapter is by far the best of the bunch.  I'm picking up signals I never saw with the other two, and they are coming in with decent percentages. The software couldn't be better.  Connection doesn't take minutes like the other two, and the radar dish antenna can be pointed for better signal gain.  I haven't had a connection loss once using it, and the internet is running at better than dial up speed (I'm connecting to a 23% signal).  
Overall, I'd pick the Netgear card for travel with a laptop due to it's size and portability, but for home use the Hawking usb adapter was head and shoulders above the others

First of all, I must give the Netgear WG511 its props. It is streamlined, configures easily and rarely drops a signal. The installation/configuration instructions are painless and I had both the PC card and compatible Netgear wireless router up and running in less than 15 minutes. My issues stem from the manufacturers less than adequate rebate "system". Having jumped through all of their flaming hoops to get the rebate information to the manufacturer, I did not receive any word on my rebate for two months. When I did, I received an email saying my rebate request was not valid. Upon some further examination and making sure they were sent all the documentation requested, I called Netgear directly. As it turns out, Netgear told me my rebate was not valid because they didn't receive the original UPC for the purchased items. I explained (repeatedly) that I could only send and original ONCE, but offered to fax them all the documentation I had INCLUDING photo copies of the original UPC, to which the declined, stating their terms and conditions only honor originals. The supervisor I spoke with was in no way helpful or willing to attempt to resolve the situation when I asked, "How can I submit originals when I sent them to you already?" and, "Let me fax you all the documentation I sent the first time..." I was eventually given the "I can neither confirm nor deny we received your original rebate request." schpiel at one point. The kicker of this whole experience was that though I sent a rebate request for TWO items, Netgear only had a request for one item. Both item requests are on one form! "How could you get a request for one without the other if they're on the same form?", I asked, which was met by, "Uh, at this time, according to our records, we only have a request for one item...If you send in a rebate request with the original UPC, we can honor your rebate request..." Essentially, I will say this: Netgear makes a wonderful consumer product. The product is reliable, user-friendly and affordable. And, I would purchase from them again - as long as there's an instant rebate. If you send in a rebate, save yourself the aggrevation and just pay full price.

The card works equally well for me on an 802.11g network at the office and a 802.11b network at home. The taskbar icon allows you to open the configuration and change the network profile very quickly. I've used it with a Netgear access point and a Linksys router, with and without WEP, and it does very well. The WG511's range and performance is almost as good as a built-in Dell 1300 wireless card, which is installed on another notebook in my office. On some rare occaisions, the driver crashes, but I have not tried any updates to the driver or firmware; in addition, it only occurs while coming out of hibernation after the network or card has been removed

I started to pass up the chance to rate this until I saw how high the overall rating is.  The user group on the NETGEAR www site documents how unstable this card is and the dopped internet connection issue.  I agree with all those who mention ease of installing etc.- then BAMM! After about 2 months, internet connectivity becomes an issue.  I had not been to the NETGEARS users group before.  Before buying this item go to their web site and search for "internet drop".  Lots of customers are dissatisfied with this card-BEWARE! I have tried lots of fixes-uninstalling/reinstalling/using the NETGEAR Mgr/using the WIN XP mgr-nothing seems to work. Untold hours spent.  This is my last gasp-now searching for a Linksys replacement as recommended by others

 Background
I broke my old Netgear 802.11b PCMCIA card for my work laptop (don't ask) and I needed to get a PCI card for my son's older PC, so I decided to replace my older Netgear 802.11b wireless router - and get all three items together. I couldn't find ONE router with generally good reviews. They seemed to be all over the map - some people loved it - others hated it. Since I had good luck with my original Netgear, I decided to go with the Netgear brand and ended up buying three items from Amazon due to the deal they ran ($25 off) and the Netgear rebates. I purchased:

Netgear WG511 Wireless 802.11g PC Card
Netgear WG311 54 Mbps Wireless PCI Adapter
Netgear WGR614 802.11g Wireless Router (version 6)

The PCI card was for my son's older, Windows 98SE PC, the PCMCIA card was for my work laptop (Win2K), and the router was for the family's main PC (XP SP2). We have a cable ISP (Optimum).

Router Installation
I uninstalled all hardware/software for the original router and followed the instructions as prompted by the installation software for the new router. I had absolutely no problems. I didn't even need to bring down any new firmware - I have "version 6" of the router which could make a difference I guess.

First Use
After stepping through the installation, logging on to the router, and setting the wireless encryption, etc. I was up and running on the main PC. It took no longer than 30 minutes.

Wireless Installs
The PCMCIA card install on my laptop was just as smooth. The card sensed the wireless signal (as well as a few other secure and unsecured networks in my neighborhood). I added the encryption key (WPA-PSK) and was off and surfing. My brother-in-law and sister-in-law were over and they both had their laptops (with non-Netgear wireless routers) and they were able to hop on the router after I gave them the encryption key. My son's PC - which I was expecting to be problematic due to it being 98SE - was smooth as well. His PC is in his room directly above the router and it grabbed the signal right away.

Wireless Use
As I mentioned above, we had 4 people wirelessly connected and they all were surfing as if hardwire connected. It was very impressive. I have not experienced any dropped signals nor have I had to reset the router in the past 3 weeks of daily use.

Price
I paid $118 for all three of the items together (about $40 for each), but I got $25 off immediately from Amazon and will be getting another $40 back from Netgear. So - $50 and change for the three of them

Very easy installation---no problems with getting it up and running in 20 mins on my Windows 98 laptop.  Works great with the NetGear router.  Strong/fast signal 30 feet from my router.  Be sure to follow install CD steps carefully and you should be fine.

I recently added both a Netgear wireless router and PC card to my mom's computer.  The router installed quickly and with no problem.  The card was a different story.

I started the process, followed all the steps and waited.  And waited.  The install seemed to have stalled, but there were no warnings, no update boxes of any kind.  So I restarted the process; same thing, after a while it just stopped.

On a hunch, I hooked the computer back up to the internet using the Ethernet connection and sure enough, this time the install ran like it was in the Indy 500 with no problems.  So, even though it seems counterintuitive, when installing this wireless card make sure you're still hooked up to the internet

As Jewel cases don't really need to do much more than hold your CDs and DVDs, if it works, it works.  You would have to TRY to make them unusable and therefore bad.  In that respect, these do the job.  You gotta love the space they eliminate.  I wish regular disc cases were this thin

Lost cases, or copies. You can get spindles of CD/DVDrs, but how do you keep track after?

These are nice quality for the money and take up minimal space compared to full-width. I haven't solved the problem yet of how to know which is which edge-on. I have to pull them out and look. There ought to be stubby labels that you could put on to flag them top, middle and bottom with enough width to write on. The tradeoff of being able to store more discs in the same space is, that lack of identifiability

I've owned this webcam for months and very satisfied so far. For such price I didn't expect anything remotely like Nikon DSLRs (hardware-wise), however it turned out that the light metering, shutter speed and aperture of this tiny thing are all quite right, even under some really complex lighting conditions. (I'm a long-time avid photographer) The zooming is digital but not optical, but then again it is really a consumer gadget targeted at mass-market.The video is reasonably smooth. The panning and tilting works well. The bundled software is quite impressive. Not necessarily the most cutting-edge computer vision algorithms are implemented, but it's really nice to see creative get quite a few applications featuring object detection and motion tracking. Some people complained the face detection didn't work out well for them. It's really not the hardware's fault but can be improved by employing some not-so-primitive, state-of-the-art computer vision algorithms in the software. That means we can always hope Creative to release more advanced software or even roll out our own (oops, the driver is closed-source, but there is workaround for this issue if one really wants to hack along...). Tip for a quick fix is: do not expose any object which has the similar colour and similar shape of your face to the webcam. This way, the software is not likely to get confused and will track your face well. I experimented with my hand in front of the cam, the little robot eye stared straight at my palm and followed it when I waved my hands. This tells that in the software, the rules defining a "face" is really primitive for now. (I wonder what will this little camera do when it sees an African whose face is nearly RGB(0, 0, 0), can it still track?) And I'd like to see a driver for Linux too. I run Debian most of the time recently, don't want to reboot to windows just in order to use this webcam. 

The visual surveillance feature is cool. It suggests a really nice application possibility of this camera. Creative put these ideas together and created a decent and stylish UI for utilizing this little robot eye, appreciated here. 

This cam looks good and is well built. It's especially cute when it does track your face's motion and stares straight at you, just like a cat or a little kid. The blue illuminated circles at each side looks modern and elegant.

I bought this cam for several reasons. My parents live far away from me,    a webcam can be a great tool for our communication; My boyfriend is a hardcore researcher working on automatic video segmentation, feature recognition, etc. We are just curious about the trend of applications in the consumer market and how far have the consumer-oriented products gone, technology-wise. Creative webcam live motion's performance meets my need for a visual aid of the remote communication. As a practical tool it is more than adequate; Both my boyfriend and me had great fun when tweaking, cheating and playing with this little robot eye and we cannot wait to write our own applications for it. It is also a great toy. Thus 5 stars.

PS: Creative just released some really flashy software called "advanced video FX" for this camera, freely available from their website. Though not anything really that innovative, still a nice move. And I really hope they  would release some SDK so that people can implement better algorithms for  applications like remote monitoring, motion tracking...for this webcam.

The webcam is just like any other ordinary Logitech webcam.  Nothing new or great about it.  The description given by the manufacturer seems to claim that this is the best webcam in the world.  Don't believe any word from the manufacturer.  If you already have a webcam, don't re-invest in this.

The "face-recognizing" software is a joke.  It takes any bright light ahead of the webcam as a "face".  If two or more people stand in front of the camera, it goes crazy trying to figure out what to do and does what it can do best... hang or freeze.  I had to close the software and restart it 7 times in an hour.  I returned the webcam after using it for 2 days

I am not satisfied with this Creative Webcam Live! Motion- Titanium. I bought this even of the higher cost because I thought it should be the best. However,the authomatic sensor is junk and the headphone is broken. The tracking device is not very good because each time I moved the captured picture would blur and freeze. The pant and tilt control is a pain. Although it works well with Yahoo messenger, as a buyer, you should consider spending time reading other reviews of a procuct that you are interested. Higher price does not mean good product

The Creative WebCam Live! Motion takes some huge steps forward with it's wide angle lens, pan and tilt capability, remote capability, and image tracking capability.

However, some of this technological leap forward takes some steps backward as the sharpness of the picture isn't quite as good as what is possible with a stationary fixed focus webcam.  There is quite a bit of distortion in the pictures too which I attribute to the wide angle lens and the plastic cover over the lens.

Software installation was easy and clean.  The instructions say to connect to the computer directly via USB and not to hook up the unit to a hub but that is almost impossible considering the length of attached USB chord.  My webcam is connected thru one of my USB 2.0 hubs and is working fine.  Another weak point is the face tracking software. Some times it would focus in on me and other times it would wander aimlessly making my friends that are watching very dizzy.

I will give this unit 4 out of 5 because over all it is a good product with a good feature set.  Comparing this device to like devices still makes this product a leader because let's face it, a really good, super high quality webcam for a reasonable price just doesn't exist yet.

I use my webcam to make what my granddaughter and I call "computer calls."  We actually use the telephone for audio so that each household can use the speakerphones and use the cameras only for the video portion.  I had a Logitech Quickcam Pro 4000 which I did not find particularly good.  Furthermore, it kept falling out of its base.  Because my husband is so much taller than I am, I wanted a camera that would do panning up and down.  This camera is perfect for our needs.  We use the panning control panel - not the Smartface tracking.  The picture is much better than my Logitech picture, whether we use Yahoo Messenger or the SightSpeed that came with the camera.  I do not agree with any of the other reviews that have negative things to say about the video, but I do not intend to do a full "conference" with this camera, do not intend to use it for audio, and do not intend to use the face tracking.  So, if your needs are as simple as mine, this is a great camera.  However, I bought mine on eBay, where I paid considerably less than the Amazon price, so I have no complaints about the camera's possible shortcomings compared to its price.  For my needs, this camera is of considerably higher quality than the Logitech Quickcam pro 4000

The camera works fine with Yahoo Instant Messenger, and with the software that Creative includes with the product.  But we got the camera to use it with AIM which is what the rest of our distributed family uses.  Alas, neither AIM 5.9 nor AIM Triton displays anything from the the camera.  Creative's support has been frustrating.  They have suggested a number of things to do if the camera doesn't work at all, ignoring the fact that I've told them where the camera does work, and that we get the same results on two very different computers.  

The problem may be with AIM, but then Creative's website and tech support should just say that, instead of encouraging users to think that it does work.  I've found several entries on the web indicating others having the same problem.

If you use a power strip, you probably have something plugged into it that is so big that it covers more than one outlet.  Buy a few of these and you can free up that space and use all of the outlets on your power strip.  A no brainer, really.

The maker of this product also makes a splitter version.  Plug it into your power strip and it gives you TWO MORE OUTLETS

My reasons for purchasing this keyboard and mouse were quite simple.  I work from home full time and my desk serves as both my work and home desk and I wanted to be able to share a keyboard and mouse without an annoying KVM switch that might or might not work.  The MX3200 Laser has exceeded my expectations.  To switch from laptop to home desktop is as easy as unplugging the small SecureConnect USB mini-receiver from one and plugging it in to the other.  And because I'm using the desktop receiver stand it has easy access.  So, for my money and what I'm using it for I am extremely happy with my purchase.  As a side note, all of the other technology that comes with it is quite impressive as well

The one thing that was not mention by Amazon is that this case is designed and intended for 1st generation ipods only!  I purchased mine and was quite disappointed by the fact that Amazon failed to mention this important fact.  Although the case is made of quality material and seem to fit my 20 GB ipod nicely, the two outer buttons above the click wheel will not be accessible once the ipod is in the case.  But if all you want is something to hold your ipod, this may do the job as long as you are will to pay the listed price.  I believe you can find something more functional for a cheaper price

This case does not work well with the ipod.  When in the case, you cannot work the button controls-- rewind, fastforward.  The case scratches the ipod upon inserting and removing due to the hard leather stiching on the inside of the case.  Good idea, bad execution

I wrote this review simply to correct the individual who wrote "Digital cables either transmit the bits or not."  Uh... not quite ... it might surprise you, but there is science behind this stuff.  That is why certain cable companies - not just Monster, mind you - charge more than $20 for a cable.  If interested, read on.

"Digital" refers to an encoding technique where a signals are composed of a stream of high and low logic levels (0 = low and 1 = high).  People who haven't studied microprocessors like to stop there and say "heck, any cable can transmit 0's and 1's! Why should I pay more?"  What they don't understand, however, is what constitues a 0 or a 1 or how these signals are interpreted by a modern microprocessor.

Without going too heavy into this ... most people have heard of logic "gates" (transistors) - extremely large clusters of transistor form the backbone of CPUs, etc.  Just as it takes energy for you to open a door, these "gates" are "opened" and "closed" by energy, and it comes in the form of voltage.  Bare with me...

"Noise" is impossible to completely eliminate in any circuit.  As a result, logic high (the digital "1") has a certain threshold that must be met in order to "open" the logic gate - this prevents noise from corrupting the signal and injecting false positives.  What does this mean?  

Well, it means that a certain level of voltage must be present for a microprocessor to detect that there has been a transition from logic low (approx. 0 volts) to logic high (above the threshold voltage).  -----MAJOR----- This is where the non-initiated are mistaken!!  Digital is NOT simply a finite 0 or a finite 1, at least not during tranmission.  There are transients (i.e. time where the voltage increases and falls) during transmission.

A good cable will A) shield the main conducting wire from more noise and B) have less impedence which will, in turn, make the transients more true - 0's and 1's on the source side will correlate better to the 0's and 1's on the receiving side.  This will maintain the fidelity of your signal and allow your digital stream of 0's and 1's to sound and look nice.

Over short lenghts, you'll have to decide if there is a difference.  For long lenghts, you might be surprised.  HDMI traditionally tops out at 5m.  Anyhow, as the title says, You Decide

Only analog cables can possibly make any difference to the signal. Digital cables either transmit the bits or not. Monster would like you to think that the cool-looking connectors are worth $170, but as long as they don't fall off, this cable will be equivalent to a $17 hdmi cable, of which you can buy 5, just in case, and keep half of your money in your pocket

I bought a very nice Samsung 32' LCD for around $1400.  A few days later I got the HD cable box from Time Warner Cable. It came with a generic component video wire for HD hook up.  The picture was okay, but overall I was extremely disappointed.  I had seen the TV at countless stores and knew the picture was better than what I was witnessing.  It was far from what it should be.  After looking into various cables, I decided that Monster HDMI/DVI was the way to go.  I had read the reviews and yes it is expensive but I decided that if I was going to spend $1400 on a great TV I was going to go the extra mile to make sure I got the best picture out of it.  The second I plugged in the cable I knew I made the correct decision.  Crystal clear HDTV.  Far better than the generic cable and even better than I had seen in the store.
My honest assessment is that the cable is over priced, but only slightly (it does have a lifetime warranty). Monster boasts the clearest picture, and I believe it.
If you are going to spend all that money on a nice TV for your home entertainment center, you should also spend a little extra money to get the most out of it. You will be glad that you did

There is no need to buy such an overpriced cable.  They are making a fortune off of marketing and making you think you need such a cable.  Just get a generic that costs 1/8th the price.  You won't notice a difference

The tv has many many features that are pretty much useless to most people. I have had this tv for about 3 weeks now and cannot find anything wrong with it. Great tv for the price

Just bought this for my bedroom.  The picture looks great! The sound is a little lacking, especially when I am running on my treadmill the same time, but if you turn it up, you can still hear it.  It's light weight and easy to hook up.  Overall a great product.

I have a 20" Aquos and love everything about it, so when I needed a smaller set for the kitchen I bought this one. When I hooked it up I was very disappointed with the sound system. The sound must be turned nearly all the way up to reach normal levels and then the speakers sound "tinny". Not even as good as a 15 year old 13" Sony. Took it back and the retailer admitted it was the weak point of the system

I tried two other flat screen tv's out prior to buying the Sharp, but returned both because either they stuck out from the wall too far, or the online reviews indicated future speaker problems.  Sharp lcd's are rated well by Consumer's Reports, and I'm very happy with the picture and quality on this one.  The only thing that I'm not thrilled with is that the specs called out that this was under 3" thick, but it is actually a little more than 3" thick.  Overall, it's a high quality tv for a good price

I researched LCD TVs on the internet and went to stores before buying this TV. Out of the other brands, this one made more sense and looked better in its picture quality on display compared to the Phillips and Samsung. This one was more elegant and sleak. The sound quality was better too. The picture quality on displayed looked great so I went to Circuit City and bought it for $492 (Includes tax and recycling CA tax) on 11/30/05. I was happy with my purchase until I turned it on at home. Although the sound quality is superb, the picture is very dark. I've tried different settings to get a lighter picture unsuccessfully. The contrast on this LCD is 500:1, and I guess that's not enough. The resolution is also not great. I recommend the Sharp Aquos 15" LCD TV for everything except the picture quality.

I do not own this coby product but have purchased coby in the past. I bought a coby tv dvd combo and a coby dvd recorder. Both items didnt last a year. The recorder didnt last a month. Coby is a generic brand that was put out to make money by selling cheaper than the name brands. There products are pretty much disposable. Use them for a little bit and have to throw them out. I will never again purchase anything from this company. You really do get what you pay for with electronics. Beware!!

Do not buy this product! Whatever you do, go with another DVD player. It's a real pain putting in a DVD. You need to make sure you have it clicked in right, or it will jam. I actually scratched a few DVDs not getting it all click into its round motorized holder

I agree with all the bad reviews of this player. My mum bought 2, none of them work. Wrong disc, makes noise, won't play, even store bought dvd's. Very disappointing because we travellled with it for our vacation and I was looking forward to enjoying some movies. I wish I had brought the kids playstation instead

I have bought three of these dvd players under the impression that they were a great buy.  Since that I have come to find out that I was dead wrong.  All three are no longer working. The warranty is still in effect, but Coby wants you to pay $25.00 for shipping and handling to replace it. Thats what I paid for the dvd player. Keep this in mind before you purchase one of these

As I'm writing this review (sort of), I am hearing a skipping sound coming from the player.

First of all, I can't really complain since I got this DVD player for about a dollar [...]. I won it from a Flaming Finger arcade game, but now I wish I would have chosen another prize.

a.) It does make a lot of noise! Too much if you ask anyone.

b.) It doesn't read a DVD every once in a while, then it does for some f*cked up reason.

c.) It's not worth it, no matter what anyone says. Then again, who am I to judge since I basically got for free.

d.) If you ever win at Flaming Finger, don't go for this prize, go for either season 1 of The Simpsons, Family Guy, or American Dad. Or the wireless controller for the PS2, or the freaking digital voice recorder, but not this piece of [...]. The damn headphones might even be a better choice, or a PS2 video game for that matter

A real surprise how capable the DVD player is for under $40.  The player worked as expected, remote control operated perfectly and even provided some excellent slow motion/freeze frame capability that, rivals higher-end models, was not expected.  I've only used it for about 10 hours so far but would highly recommend to anyone for a part-time portable DVD player

The product is very good and so easy to cary around.  I bought it to play PAL formated DVDs but I still can't play them.  It may be me or the tapes because this is supposed to be a code free player.  One way or the other I like it

If you're looking for an inexpensive compact dvd, this one is very good. The only negative is that it gets overheated very quickly so you might have to give it a break between dvd's. Other than that it works very well and was a very good buy

I bought this DVD player for a friend of mine because the DVD player was very compact and selling at a great price, not to mention the player as stated claim it played DVDs from all regions. To her surprised the player didn't play DVDs from Germany or from the UK, or from any other country, but Region code 1 DVDs. Shortly after she played the DVDs in the player for some time, the DVD player kept skipping, making all sorts of loud noises. It sounded really terrible. I then contact the manufacturer about the problem, they told me on the phone to send the player back to them, and they will see what the problem is. Of course they expected me to pay for the postage to send it to them and for them to send it back after they had fixed it. It cost to much for the shipment, so I decided to get her a newer and better one that cost a few bucks more. 
To all of you people who are seriously thinking about buying this DVD player better think again !! It is not worth your time, your money or the headaches !!! 
Spend a few bucks more and you can get something even good with better quality for your money

You simply can't match the value you get for the price of this gorgeous iPod. The ability to view and show others your photos and watch video is priceless. The quality of the video and images is simply incredible. This is my second iPod (the first being a 10 GB white click wheel I had for over 3 years) and I have convinced so many of my friends and family to get them. I have been able to watch almost two hours of TV shows on an airplane with no problem (haven't tried watching a full-length movie yet). Overall this is a fantastic product for the money and you will not regret your purchase

I own both the iPod (5.5) and the Zune - buy a Zune. Not only does it not scratch or get generally as dingy looking as an iPod - the screen is absurdly larger due to not having to put the brilliant "let's see how we can test our opposable thumbs wheel" navigation "aid" on the device. Not to mention, the interface itself is much more attractive and the device itself has more capabilites than the iJunk. But that's me...and not wanting to have to go through another 3 day - yes - days - synch between my WMA files and iTunes sad attempt at conversion

I upgraded from the previous generation iPod (4g), and expected this new iPod to be better in every way...well it is better in every way but one.  The interface is comparatively very slow to respond to input.  When you try to navigate through your songs, there is always a slight delay.  And when you scroll through your music, it goes scroll scroll stop (for a quarter second)...scroll scroll stop.
Overall this is a great player, and I am surprised they didn't put a faster processor in there

don't buy it here.  Go to the Apple store either online or a retail location.  There you will get the product and support you need and you won't have to wait a month or so to get that wonderful Amazon message that says they can't fill your order at this time, but would you like to wait?  And after 4 months or so of not getting your new ipod, just try getting your money back from Amazon.

My wife and I had previously owned two Philips GOGear HDD6330 30GB mp3 players and had many many problems. Mostly with syncing the songs onto the devices and also some with proper playback. The interface was also not as nice nor responsive as the iPod. So we returned the Philips players and got an 80GB and 30GB iPod. Neither has let us down once. They sound great, the battery lasts for days (4-6 hours a day use). itunes is very easy to use and seems to almost know what you need to do before you do. podcasts are neat and free, you can download tons of videos from google video, you can put pictures on it, no problems finding accessories. It is really just night and day vs. the current windows based offerings. On the 80GB iPod we have about 6,500 songs, 50 videos, 200 photos, and all of our outlook contacts and it is only about half full. Not to mention the games that come with it. If you don't mind spending a little more for quality, this is the way to go, it just works. 

My wife uses the 30GB white version and loves it. it does have a lot less space and shorter battery life than the 80 GB, but it is much slimmer feeling as far as the thickness and still has all of the other features that make iPods so great. We also both sync using the same itunes without any problems (turn off auto syncing to do this and drag songs etc to device.) This was not the case when we both were using Philips GoGears and Windows Media Player. Everyone else that I know that owns an iPod has never said anything bad about them, Apple really has a winner here, it would take a lot of convincing to ever switch me back over to windows based mp3 systems.

These batteries are do a great job of providing long life in high curent drain applicaions. I recently bought my wife an iGolf GPS unit that measures the distance to the middle of the green using GPS technology. The unit works great but only lasts ~ 10 hours on a set of alkaline AA batteries. After looking into some alternatives I found that these Energizer AA NiMH batteries have the highest capacity (mAh) of the brand name batteries available. The result is that after a full charge she can get upwards of 12-14 hours of iGolf usage before the batteries run out. You can access the technical specification sheets on the enegizer web site and detemine if they would work well in your particular application. I suspect that some of the other reviewers which are having problems may be using them in devices where 1.2V (NiMH chemistry) do not work well and require a conventional battery (zinc carbon or alkaline) that delivers a full 1.5V. If your application can use the slightly lower voltages that these deliver then they are a great buy and should save you some money in the long run

I use these batteries with the Energizer Quick (15-min) charger. It's important to note that these are the 2500 mAH batteries. Energizer also makes 2100 and 2200 versions that are sometimes erroneously listed as 2500 on others' websites. These are the real deal.

They charge within 15 minutes in the charger and keep their charge as indicated. I keep extras with me when I am photographing, as my flash is power hungry. I often get more flashes out than the manufacturer claims is possible with its own proprietary battery.

I have charged, discharged, and recharged them many times with no noticeable loss. They do get very hot in the charger and need to cool before using. Also--and this is probably obvious--they do not work once wet, even if allowed to dry. (I had an unfortunate experience with a canoe and a lake.

Like serveral below, i am using these with my Canon S2 IS.  I think they are awesome.  I'm very picky about battery life and i think these last great.  i don't have them long enough to know if they diminish over time.  I used these battery in a mini tape recorder too.  It lasted over several days at 1 hour record time each day.  I do have an 8 hour charger and it doesn't bother me one bit.  Haven't anyone heard "faster isn't better?"  I wouldn't trust the 15minute charger.  who knows what it does to the battery.  i am content with waiting for 8 hours and be sure my battery recieves a complete charge.  I wouldn't hesitate to buy these again

I agree that they are expensive, but they are very comfortable compared to the other headphones on the market - for the size and weight they are great.

These headphones are technically "circumaural", meaning they cover around the ear. Most of the products this size and weight are only "semi-circumaural" - meaning that they are very uncomfortable on people with average size ears, because they sit on top of part of the ear. 

The triports fit very nicely around the ear, which in my book is worth the extra $50.00 for the comfort to be able to wear an extra hour or 2.

The sound quality is not that bad either, actually is exceptional if you ask me - and I own the Sennheiser HD497 (semi-circumaural) and Etymotic Research ER-6i (ear bud - use these for traveling) - which the triports compare just fine with both

Many people think that just because it's Bose it's crap.  It's not true, in fact, all headphones are good based merely on subjectivity.  However, I own these cans, and I think they sound great.  They are fragile, but with a small amount of vinyl tape I have kept them together. I don't know if it was worth $150, but they're the best headphones I've ever worn, not to mention the most comfortable.

Senn/Grado doesn't get as much marketing, but I would say that the Senn PX100 are comparable to these (but too small for me)

I purchased the Triport headset with CD player.  The sound is absolutely unbelievable.  I compared it with an inexpensive headset that came with another CD player.  Really no comparison.  Then I tried a Digital headset.  Still relatively terrible.  The TriPort is great.  Sound is better than at any concert and most sterio systems

I purchased these because I could not use any earbud-type headphones (they kept falling out no matter what). I am pleased in that they have great sound quality and are very lightweight for full-sized headphones. They also block out a lot of nois

The sound from these headphones is excellent. But they aren't made very well. I have gone through 3 pairs of these things, but the people at Bose are extremely good about replacing broken sets. I believe these are the headphones that Apple uses for ipod displays, so you can go into an apple store to check out how they sound for yourself

First of all, I didn't pay $150 for these like everyone else here. I got these for $80 including tax from my friend who works at Best Buy. Even still after getting a great deal I think that I paid way too much. These headphones sound OK. Not bad at all but there is nothing amazing about the sound either. I think the fair price for these headphones should be around $50. The biggest complain of all reviewers is that these headphones are very fragile and easy to break. Well it's a good thing that I learned my lesson by reading these reviews. I've been really careful with these headphones since I got them 3 days ago. They only come in a soft case which is incapable of protecting these headphones. So I've been putting these in a hard cardboard box when I am not using them. I believe that if the continue to keep this routine I should be able to extend the life of these headphones. I am going to repeat what another reviewer wrote. If you are paying such a high price ($150) for these headphones why don't you take care of them. I mean do you really abuse something like a fine piece of jewelry that cost hundred of dollars? The answer is NO. So why can't you guys handle this product with care? There is a reason this product is very fragile. Because it is light as hell. In order to make this headphone comfortable, Bose made this product very light. So why these reviewers keep complaining about the fragileness of this product? It common sense. You can't have your cake and eat it too! These headphones are by far the lightest and most comfortable headphones that I have ever stumbled upon. So give Bose some credit for creating headphones which sound good and are comfortable too.

When I bought this, I didn't do any research.  I just went out and picked it up.  The first thing I liked was how compact it was.  You can hide it anywhere on your desk.  Also, the tranfer mate is great to use.  You just push the button and the wizard comes up asking you what you want to transfer.  Excellant product!

I have an almost constant stream of guests who rapidly fill up the memory capacity on their digital cameras and/or want to exchange images with others. Invariably they will not have their USB cable with them. I keep the reader permanently connected and on my desktop. This reader allows me to quickly create a CD for them or transfer images from one card to another

Couldn't get much easier than this. 

Unpacked it, plugged it in and plugged my cards in.

It automatically create logical drives on your OS. That is, you'll see new drives (like M. N, O, P), and it's a bit annoying trying to figure what drive maps to what cards, but you'll get used to it quickly and it's not like it's a huge annoyance.

I love this card reader.  The speeds with the USB2 Are incredible!  The only gripe I have is that it keeps crashing my Windows XP Pro SP2 high end Dell computer.  

I have notified Microsoft about it, so maybe they have a suggestion or perhaps they can work together with Sandisk to alleviate this issue

Had mine for a long time with never a problem. Did not install software and Win XP automatically sees any card plugged into it. Use CF and xD cards with mine. Always had a problem pushing in a CF card until I discovered you need to slant the card to the right slightly then it pushes in easily. Xd cards are also a little tricky to push in but you soon learn how to push them in correctly. Never could figure out what the button on the side was used for, thanks to other reviewers I now know it only works if you install the software. I don't know how I could be without this reader. Who wants to hook up your camera to your computer to download pictures or video, not me, this works great and fast and the LED's for each card slot let you know everythings working. I love it, highly recommend it, get it.

This reader is fast, easy to use, and pleasing to the eye. My only problems would be that the software is pretty much useless to me (not why I took away a star) and the fact that the base is WAY too light in weight. Every time I try to insert a card I have to hold on to the entire unit so it doesn't slide off the desk. Other than that, I am extremely happy with this product and would definitely purchase other SanDisk products in the future

I purchased these speakers and they were wonderful, but after using a few days I could not get the speakers to stay on. I returned it and Amazon sent me another one. The same thing happened again. I'm returning this one and getting my money back.

I think the flaw with this device is you press and hold the button to turn the speakers and the mp3 player on at the same time. After a few days of use your mp3 player will turn on but the speakers won't. Too bad.......when it works it's great

This little gem is very compact and has a bigger sound than I was expecting. It is convenient and simple to use. My 9 year old uses it and it is sturdy enough that I don't have to worry about it getting broken. The hard case has a flip over cover and it also comes with a soft carrying case. It is great on trips, especially when you don't have a computer with you to charge your Zen. If you are an audiophile, the sound will not be good enough for you, but for the average person, it will exceed expectations

First of all, I am not a "home theater expert."  I did not even know I needed a receiver for the theater speaker system.  That not withstanding, after I got the speakers, (and a receiver I might add) I hooked everything up to my Direct TV and DVD.  WOW what a sound.  I have a BOSE system in my family room and this system is in my home office, which is quite big.  This system I rate a good as the BOSE system I paid a lot more for.  I only wish I had waited a week and got the extra $$$ off what I paid for it!  But it is a good buy.  And, I got it in only one day after I ordered it.  Talk about fast delivery

Originaly I had bought one of thoes DVD player 5.1 combo kits. And well the wire and spekers were not much to talk about. Since the DVD player had a built in amp, I bought this Jenson system. All I can say is good things. The first DVD I put in to the player was Star Wars Empire Strikes Back, and you could hear everything! You heard the snow compacting as Han walked over the Land on Hoth! An added plus is that the Sub Woofer has a volume nob on it and is powered seperately. Which is great if your DVD player or amp can bot turn up base anymore. In this case you can just over ride it essentialy. In short, Awesome system! Awesome price, and it looks good too. Other reviews say that this system sounds better then a $500.00 system, and They are right. If not better it is very comparable. Buy this and be happy! I recomend 18 gauge speaker wire when hooking this up. Anything smaller would not do the system justice

I did hook up these little ones to my old Yamaha RV-703 receiver using a Sony DVP-NS400 DVD player with Dolby Digital 5.1 built-in decoder. For 59 bucks and free shipping, these speakers rock. If you are planning on buying a system for your bedroom, or building a system within a budget, I recommend these speakers 100%.

I picked these up for a 20 year-old JVC stereo/amp with a CD player hooked up to it for under $100. I wasn't expecting the greatest sound, but for Radio Shack clear-out speakers and a 20 year-old amp I got a crystal clear sound that sounds just as good as the Sony home-theater-in-a-box that I paid $400 for. The sub-woofer has a seperate volume control on the back, so you can decide how much bass you want. Excellent speakers for the price

This has been a great keyboard. It is silent and the keys have a firm feel when I press them. The keys' profiles are flatter than the Apple keyboards and that makes it easier to move from one key to the next.

I have not used the software which came with it, but the only thing which does not function correctly is the CD-ROM player reject button, I use Function key F-12 to perform this function (this is usng OS X.3.9 and 9.2.2).

If I had to do it over again (buy a new keyboard), I would do it over again, except sooner

This is a great keyboard. It fits in well next to my macbook pro!! Definitely happy with it, and will buy another when this wears out.

Pro's: 
Good looks
Short Throw Keys
Plug and Play with Mac

Cons:
Keys get a little squeeky after a few months hard use
No print screen button for use on Windows machines
The eject and volume buttons are again useless for Windows
(The last two are clearly stated on their product page, so no surpises there)

The only problem I have with this keyboard is that I had questions regarding it and sent two emails to Macally, through their customer service website, and never received an answer.  I guess they don't really care if they sell one or not and it makes me wonder if I should have problems down the road if they will give any response to a problem.  I was trying to choose between two different Macally keyboards.   

That being said, I have to say I went ahead and ordered the IceKey because I really needed a new keyboard bad (coffee spill!).  This keyboard works great, I really do think you type faster on it.  The touch is really nice with a little click, but responsive and not noisy.  It only needs a touch.  The reach on a few keys is a little different but nothing you can't adjust to.  Everything works the same with my iMac as the old Apple Pro I was using.  Another plus is that if it gets dirty you can wipe it clean, nothing can get caught in a see through area that you can't get to. 

I read only great reviews on this keyboard and I have to say they were all true.  I also have to add that I am pretty fussy and I don't adjust to change very well so finding a keyboard without being able to try it out first was a real worry for me.  I hate ordering and sending back.  Well I lucked out here,  I would never send my IceKey back

The keyboard so far is great.  I've been using it for two weeks now, and only have 1 minor complaint.  If I am being lazy, slumping back in my chair with my thumb resting across the base of the keyboard, it is sometimes a little tough to 'thumb' the space bar, because of the low profile of the keys.  This issue does not bother me, because I quickly adjusted, but I thought I would point it out.  The curious part has to do with 2 keys and an apparently useless LED.
First the keys; There is a blank key on the bottom right of the main set of keys.  No idea what it is for.  It doesn't seem to do anything.  I suppose you could map it to something useful, but I have no idea how to do that.  The other interesting key is the num lock/clear key.  This ties into the numlock LED.  Pressing the numlock key does not seem to toggle the numlock LED.  Likewise, I don't know what the keys do if numlock weren't on.  No alternatives are listed on the keys.  Not a big deal, just kind of peculiar.  I use a keyboard to make a living as a software developer.  I really like this one

I love it's dependability and most important, the "feel"
Excellent for those who must spend many hours typing.
I like it far better than the Mac keyboard that came
with my iMac and that's saying a lot. Plus you

I switched from a Powerbook to a Mac Mini and was in search of a keyboard that felt like I was typing on my Powerbook (effortlessly).  Although nothing can beat the powerbook's keyboard, this does quite a close job.  I first started using the apple pro keyboard with my mac mini and was not used to having to press down so hard on the keys that I always ended up missing letters when I typed up a document or anything for that matter.

Then I read the reviews on this puppy and decided to give it a try.  Best buy I've made.  It's very easy to use and smooth too.
I love that it has special function keys for the Mac and that it also has 2 usb ports.  The one thing that would make this keyboard even better is if it were wireless (bluetooth specifically).  Although don't let that deter you from buying this, especially if you just hide all your wires behind the computer anyway.

There's also this weird blank key on the keyboard.  It has no function whatsoever and you can't program it to do anything.  It's just there.  Weird.  But I only noticed it when I first tried it out and have never noticed it again.  But I figure it's  worth mentioning for those of you who are extremely particular about things.  

It's a great keyboard for a great price.  If you don't mind the cord and want to type with extreme ease, i think you'll love this one.

What can be said about a network switch?  It works or it doesn't, really.  I have no complaints about this switch, it works well.  I've had good luck with all D-Link hardware, really.  One interesting feature is that it has an indicator to show if a network device is connected at 10Mbps or 100Mbps.  I didn't know that one of my older computers had a 10M card in it until I got this switch

I bought two of these DSS8+ 10/100 switches to replace two 3com 10M hubs figuring I would just unplug the 3com hubs and replace with the DLink switches and it would work great. BIG MISTAKE. Once I switched to DSS8+, all the computers would no longer browse the network. AND DLINK WOULD NOT HELP ME. I phoned tech support and left my name and number. They kept me on hold over 30 minutes. They would not call me back. I wrote three emails spread out over two weeks to DLink. They would not answer me. I filled out a Tech Support form on their web page. No answer at all. Now I'm left with two DSS8+ that won't work for me. I plugged back in the slower 3com hubs and everything is working again as before. I would love to have used the faster DLink products, but with their TOTAL LACK OF TECH SUPPORT (even the courtesy to answer one of my six inquiries), I can't recommend DLink products any more

I've been using one of these D-Link switches for almost a year with high performance, and absolutely zero trouble. Like one other reviewer, I paid much more, and would do it again. Slim profile and good mount points mean you can put it almost anywhere. Great for the small or home office users who want true 100 megabit performance, without headaches

First of all, I must start out by saying that I am a little surprised that this little mechanical device is even necessary with all of the technological advances out there these days.  The HL-10 is kind of a "throw back to the seventies" in terms of its jerry rigging function.  Having said this...  Plantronics builds quality stuff and I am sure that there is a good reason for it.  The device does exactly what it is supposed to do once you adjust it for your individual phone.  I was a little concern that it would fit my phone but they include plenty of adjustment options to take care of any setup.  I am using it with a Plantronics CS351N  headset - which I love for it professional wireless function.  I tested the HL-10 by picking up/hanging up the headset 10 times in sucession and the lifter raised and lowered the receiver successfully each time.  That was good enough for me.  Definitely worth the $ if you own a wireless headset and you roam around the house/office while talking on the phone.

$20 for a composite cable?!  Prior to buying these, I thought this was too expensive, and had mostly been using cheap $5 connectors.

Well, I took the plunge on these babies.  On a 32" WEGA tv, these really make a huge difference.  Clarity is amazing!  Better than my generic S-Video cable.

Too bad these don't come in an intermediate length of 6 feet, because 4 feet is a bit short, and 8 feet is too long

These cables are definitely worth the money.  My 27" TV had cheap A/V wires hooking up the cable box to the television.  When I bought a new 32" TV I couldn't understand why the picture quality was inferior to the older tv that we had.  Well it turned out to be the cheap cables that we were using.  The 32" tv showed the imperfections much more than the 27" tv.  But after we got these cables wow was the picture clearer and the colors more vibrant.  If you don't have an S-video port or component cables, I definitely suggest going with these high quality A/V cables from monster

I recently purchased a Canon i6210 printer and needed paper for it. The Canon printer coupled with the paper makes absolutly amazing prints. It is very difficult to tell the difference between prints on this paper and processed photos

When I first bought these headphones I was amazed at the quality and at how well they blocked out outside sounds, allowing me to really hear what was coming through the headphones. Whether I am using these on my computer, keyboard or with my guitar I get excellent sound, and all for such a reasonable price

I've had mine for over a year, and they still work and sound great. I guess if you throw them around they might develop problems, but mine have been used for home stereo, and guitar practice (using a ampworks guitarworks interface). Truth is they sound great on the stereo, or with the guitar and are able to cover all the options when playing my guitar through them. They reproduce everything from very clean Jazz and blues to heavy metal crunch, and even when I'm jamming loud they hold together well and cover the spectrum clearly without distortion. 

They're more comfortable than my Sennheiser 280 pro headset that I use for recording, and the sound reproduction is pretty good when comparing the two considering the difference in cost.

Simply put you would be hard pressed to find a better headset for the mone

All these people who gave a review lower then 4 stars must not be recording engineers, therefore downgrading tha product becuase they wanna play music thru a DVD HOME THEATOR SYSTEM is nothin but pure Noob Nonsense.

All I Can Say Is If You Don't Use The Headphones Properly, What Do You Expect??

Anyway I like these headphones, its BEST USED FOR A COMPUTER WITH EQ's, "NOT FOR PORTABLE CD PLAYERS". CD Players have no eq's powerful enough to compare to a computer. I say use this product if your at home most of the time or DJ use or studio use.

Sound - The sound is beautiful. The bass is very good. Very smooth with no distortion. Once again i'm a recording engineer, i know what i'm saying. Buy This Model On Sight It Will Be Worth The Money!

On a whim I purchased these headphones, looking for something cheap to watch movies with on my computer. I was remarkably impressed. The sound is exceptional, and the bass is beautiful. I am in love with the extra long cable, which i have yet to find in any other headphones. Most extraordinary, however, is the durability. I have had these headphones for two years now, using them on average five hours a week, and have yet to have a problem. Last christmas, i wanted a pair to keep in my suitcase, and i bought some other pair and the ear piece coverings fell off within the first week. These headphones are a class act through and through

I normally would never pay so much for earbuds, but I splurged and don't regret it one bit. The ~$80 i got them for was well worth it, i can't imagine how the $300-$400 could be so much better as to warrant that much more of a cost. These things are great

This definitely does not have full range.  Some songs I listen to have very low base frequencies.  I would have been fine if I could hear it, but it was quieter.  That's what I was expecting.  To my surprise, entire bass lines were completely absent from the songs when listened to through these E2s.  And the sound isolation is something I'm new to.  I've been using old AIWA noise cancellation headphones, which work better.  Whether you want isolation or cancellation, my bet is that there's a much better product for the price, and I intend to find it

I had a pair of these for about 2 years and used them constantly. I did end up abusing them a bit and had the busted one of the earbuds. I immediately purchased another pair, they're just that great! They block out more outside noise than most of those gigantic headphones, and they fit in you pocket! The audio quality of these earbuds is phenomenal and you'll notice you hear little details and nuances in the music that you had never noticed before. The price may be a little steep for some but if you really want high quality sound purchase these earbuds

These are great earphone for what that cost, infact they would be great for the money even if they cost more.  I used them on a plane and it blocked out over 95% of the engine noiise, I forgot I was on a plane.  When using them just around town, they block out lawn mowers, dogs, and cars whizzing by.  They sound great, and I am noticing  things in the music I never have before

I used to own a pair of these headphones and I fell in love with the in-ear design for the way it isolates the sound better than any other headphone form factor. It even keeps outside noise out better than even the big cup-style headphones since the rubber end literally sits inside your ear canal, and also stays attached to your head better than any other style of headphone - you can do cartwheels with these on and they won't fall off! This design is the real magic behind the sound quality since the sound is pumped directly into your noggin with no outside interference.
That said, I seriously doubt the claims made by self-proclaimed audiophiles who think they can actually tell the difference in sound quality between an $80 pair of headphones and a $300 pair of headphones. How much better can the miniscule parts that that drive the speakers be? I think people often claim to hear better performance because that's the only way they can justify having paid a crapload of money for a product. (for proof that audiophile fools exist, notice how Monster Cable makes expensive audio cables for digital audio systems and people who pay a lot for them claim it makes their digital audio system sound better. Duh! It doesn't matter what type of cable the digital 1s and 0s travel through - as long as the receiving end can recognize them as being either a 1 or a 0!) 
I was disappointed to see that the sure i2c stereo headset wouldn't work with my pocket PC phone, but then I searched the web for stereo headsets with similiar features and found the Bodyglove Earglove Sport stereo headset. For 1/4 the price, I found a better set of headphones! It has the same micro in-ear form factor as the e3c headphones, which unlike the e2c are so deep in your ear that you can wear them as you lay the side of your head on the arm of a sofa without any discomfort! True that the e2c are small and ergonomic, but not as small and ergonomic as the micro e3c and Earglove.
Bottom line: Regardless of who you are, you will appreciate the sound quality that comes from in-ear earbuds, along with the portability, fit, and comfort. A set of micro earbuds is slightly better so go for that if you can. If you're really one of those people who thinks that they can hear the difference between ultra expensive vs. "just" very good headphones, and you are confident that you won't lose your expensive headphones like I did, then Shure makes a good product for you. Otherwise I seriously recommend the Body Glove Earglove Sport headsets

   Really guys...i'm going to concur with most on here.  Those who complain about there not being enough bass are the same people who listen to music with the base pumped up so much it drowns all other sounds out.
   These headphones are simply incredible.  It is the perfect balance of highs and lows.  Very very natural.  Additionally, the clarity is phenomenal.  I would recommend testing all of the earpieces.  Personally, i found the rubber ones the most comfortable...and played with the sizes to see which worked best.  I finally found one that was consistently comfortable, and produced great sound.  
   Other observations.  (1) Most of my music is 128k bitrate. the higher it goes, the better the music.  You'll notice a difference in sound quality if you take it higher.  (2) I increased the volume output on my mp3 files.  I found it useful with these headphones...but only a touch...not a lot.  
   the only complaint i have about these is the wire management.  The little case they give you with the set is not adequate, in my opinion...but all in all, i'm quite pleased.  If you're wincing at the price...don't.  I've probably spent $100 on all the crappy headphones I got over the years.  Make an investment.  If you don't like them after 1 week, return them.  I think you'll like them though.

	We've been quite happy with this set.  People who come in to watch sports in High-Definition comment that it's like looking through a window at a stadium luxury seat.
	My wife is planning to construct bookcases on each side of our fireplace in the family room with the set on one of the shelves.  So we decided on an LCD because it would be lighter and more easy to manage. For that reason I wanted to avoid other bulky pieces of equipment. So we passed up a cable set box in favor of a cable card. The technician whom Comcast sent in to do the installation (It's a requirement that one of their personnel do this) had never done a cable card installation before. He made many calls to the office but never did accomplish his task. He left promising a supervisor would be out the next day.  I had read in some reviews from other people the set needed a signal splitter to pick up both analog and digital signals. I went to Radio Shack and bought one.  This would have worked except the splitter was defective.  The supervisor who came out the next day installed one of theirs and the picture has been perfect.
	My main complaint about the set is the on-screen TV Guide.  The instructions seem confusing and we haven't been able to add stations very easily.  Out of the box, we haven't been able to page through all of the stations which has been possible on other on-screen guides I've seen.  About all we use it for is to identify a movie or program once we have entered the station and are watching. 
	We have had occasional problems with a message on screen, upon start-up.  The message reads "Unable to pick up digital signal."  I don't know if this is a problem with the set or with Comcast's signal.  I haven't gotten around to contacting Comcast as yet.  It is relatively easy to work around the problem by entering one of the favorite channels after which the message disappears and one can enter the station one might be looking for.
	Apart from these difficulties I can't find too much about which to complain.  
	We ordered from Crutchfield which wasn't the lowest quote but we were very impressed with their service.  We got the impression that they had real people staffing their store and phones who could take care of us which they did very well

But the monster cable gave me a more vivid color and picture...

Strengths: In-built HD (ATSC) tuner, Multiple inputs, CableCard slot, Easy menu navigation, slick looks
Weaknesses: No PIP (single tuner), TV Guide setup is complicated, Black levels don't look impressive, No 1080i support
Summary: I had been looking for a good LCD tv for some time. I wanted a set that won't be outdated in 6 months, plus I did not want to pay a huge premium for a top of the line product. Well, LC-37D7U seemed to fit my bill. It offers a performance LCD tv at a fairly reasonable price (since I purchased it from Costco). 

I bought the tv about 2 weeks ago at around 2k plus taxes. For a tv loaded with features, the setup was very easy. I used the EZ setup initially. I was up and running (watching a movie in less than 15minutes. The channel setup for cable and over the air signal took some time since the tv goes through hundreds of channel. The default audio and video configuration is very close to what you may end up with. Although I have tweaked it somewhat over the past few days. The menu navigation is pretty intuitive. 


LC-37D7U has a native resolution of 1366 x 768, therefore it does not support native 1080i or 1080p resoltuion. One would expect a 37" tv to do so. However the picture quality with 720p incoming res looks stunning. It will be a while before 1080p signal becomes common. On that note, the set has a built-in ATSC tuner. You can plug in a HD media directly to the tv. However, LC-37D7U does not support PIP. The tv does support a freeze frame feature, though. It would have been nice if tey could incorporate PIP support for devices that do not require a tuner, like VCR, DVD, etc. 


The viewing modes available in LC-37D7U cover pretty much every kind of incoming signal (aspect ratio). Also, the tv remembers the viewing mode for each input which is very convenient switching from one input to another. The OPC (optical picture control) can be improved according to me. This is a feature where the tv tries to optimize brightness according to the room conditions. I find it a little too dark. This is something that I would expect Sharp to improve in later releases. 


The quick shoot mode that Sharp introduced to improve fast action scenes did not live up to the expectation. One can see obvious trailing/blurring in such scenes, expecially the dark ones. I guess under 16ms response time is not good enough for this size tv. But then most LCD tv suffer from this ghosting issue. 


I have heard complaints about viewing angle compromise with LCD sets. However, I did not observe any color or contrast shift within +- 90 degrees. If you are watching a tv at wider angles then you should have other concerns. 


I have tried 3 different LCD tvs before this. Every time I felt that the regular broadcast looked more grainy than the conventional CRT. LC-37D7U does not suffer from that problem much. One can see the deterioration but it's not significant. 


A wide variety of inputs is a nice feature. I would have preferred more S-video inputs. I realized it because both my VCR and DVD do not have component output. Now that I got a couple of component cables, and another DVD player, it doesn't bother me anymore. 


I have not yet installed CableCard so can't really comment on the ease of installation and its use. 


Overall, I believe that I have the best tv in LCD category that I can buy today for under 3k. I would recommend Sharp Aquos LC-37D5U to those of you in the market for a LCD tv. Certainly, the prices are going to fall and better tvs will be coming out. However, it's a trade off. I pulled the trigger coz I think this was a winner and I am satified.

I purchased Sharp LC-37D7U 37" LCD TV less than two month ago.The great thing about it is that picture is really great when you watching any HD programming. Plenty inputs and great sound.Unfortunately when it comes to reliability it's a different story.The thing that get me very disappointed that TV power supply stopped working and TV just died.... after all it is $3600 set. It's been more than a week now and Sharp can not provide any resolution whatsoever.
I did read similar review on CNET about the Sharp LC-37D7U failing after a week but still decide it to purchase it, because other great reviews for Sharp LC-37D7U
Bottom line: it is a great TV if it is a working on

This is my first Widescreen, HDTV or LCD television and I did extensive research prior to purchase.

The price is steep compared to some others but there are not many 37" TV's (the largest that would work in my media cabinet) on the market.  I did manage to find it on sale locally for $4,399.

The picture on HD broadcasts and DVD's is simply stunning and the product design is sleek.  I highly recommend this television.

The picture shown today is indeed the correct product with the speakers below the bottom of the screen

I'm not sure anyone would spent $4K on an on-line purchase without doing his or her research.  But just in case someone has not. . . . 

Please be aware that the photograph Amazon.com displayed for this item is not correct.  

--The LC-37D7U has one panel of speakers on the bottom of the screen (similar to the layout of the LC-37GD6U or the LC-32D7U)

--It looks like the item pictured is actually the LC-37D5U model (the one with two speakers--one on the right and left sides of the screen).

Alright, I've been a loyal Amazon customer for 6 years and this the first time I actually felt positive enough about an item to bother reviewing it.  Hopefully, I can save a few people from overanalyzing a $4k+ TV purchase as much as I have.  I spent several months investigating flat screen HDTV's.  Once I finally made the decision to drop $4k+, I was going to go with an earlier Sharp Aquos model that was on sale at a local electronics chain, but was told there would be a newer model out in about a month.  Impatient as I am, I looked into other brands IN MUCH DETAIL, notably Sony,Phillips and Toshiba, but I'm definitely glad I held out.  This TV is phenomenal.  I play a lot of video games and was worried about the burn-in, plasma wasn't even an option.

Pros
- Fantastic, can't be understated, picture
- Don't see the blurred pix with action/sports that you see w/ other LCDs
- Integrated tuner, no extra box
- Speakers are nice quality 
- Digital optical outputs eliminate the need for me to run everything through my stereo receiver
- Lightweight and compact, planning to hang on the wall eventually
- Impressed with video game graphics and ability to customize settings for each av input
- Easy to setup and use
- HD cable looks phenomenal, regular tv is just marginal, but you'll get that with any HDTV showing a non-HD channel

Con
- Manual could be a little more descriptive
- Not a fan of the TV Guide online they hype so much, don't see what the big deal is
- I'd be happier with 1 more S-video input for another game consol

I find it interesting to see all of these negative reviews. 

I bought 3 of these little monitors and have had no dead pixels, no problems at all. I do detailed graphics with them and find them equal to my old Sony 20" CRT monitors for detail and color correctness. I compared them side by side with Apple's new monitors and found the Viewsonics equal in picture quality at less than half the price.

I wonder if perhaps the people with tint problems are using PCs that are not properly configured for the monitors, or video cards that have glitches. I use only Macs, so don't have configuration problems. 

BTW: 2 are connected to my primary workstation, G5 tower, giving me 38" of work space in less of a footprint than 1 of the pair of old 20" Sonys I used to use and with more than 100 lbs less weight on my work desk!!!

This monitor has varying degrees of blur.
There are also dark spots.
Isn't ViewSonic supposed to be a reputable brand?
This unit must be a fluke -- I'm returning it for a replacement.

============= UPDATE =======================

My replacement monitor is free of defects and is working perfectly.
I am upgrading my rating from two stars to four stars.

Additionally, the Amazon exchange process was convenient and fast.
Thanks Amazon

I bought viewsonic VA902B last month. It was working fine since I bought but today, it is broken. I called the customer service/technical support about what happened and told me to return it to where I purchase. So, I called Office Depot where I purchased the monitor but told me they only have 14 days return or exchange policy. I called the customer service/technical support back but the waiting period was to long so I call back again tomorrow

I recently picked up this monitor and I was severely disappointed.  I was upgrading from a Viewsonic VA720 and *that* monitor had much better picture quality than this one.

First off, the default color setting of 6500k (pretty much standard) looked horrible.  Everything had a green tint to it.  The other settings looked equally as bad, with either a red or blue tint.  I was forced to switch to sRGB which was the only setting that showed the correct colors.  Unfortunately, doing this disables pretty much every other adjustable setting on the monitor including Brightness/Contrast.

Now on sRGB, even though the colors were correct (for the most part), everything was super-contrasted and super-saturated to the point where it was annoying.  The gamma in particular was completely off.  I had to use my video card's display settings to adjust the gamma, contrast, and brightness (as I had no other way to do it).  Even then I could not get it perfect.  In particular, the saturation was still bad (a lilac purple became deep indigo for example).

In addition, the slightest change in viewing angle caused a significant change in brightness (slumping down slightly in my chair the screen darkened a great deal).  I was playing a game where I had the same icon at the top and bottom of my screen, and the icon at the bottom was ten times brighter than the one at the top.

Another problem I noticed was scanlines.  In particular, any repeating pattern of pixels (one solid, one transparent, one solid, etc to create a transparency effect without actual transparency), such as when you highlight an image in Internet Explorer, caused it to go crazy.  The area would be covered in scanlines.

Finally, as I think a few people mentioned, there is a problem with the text being very blurry (or I think oversharpened which causes it to be hard to read).  

Overall, I was very disappointed.  I've already plugged my old monitor back in and I am returning this one.  After a few problems with my old one (not nearly this bad!) that caused me to upgrade in the first place, I'm pretty leary about trying another Viewsonic product.  If this is what passes for quality, I'm not sure it's worth even considering another one of their monitors

Good:
Software capability - I was able to use the software to find every single remote device I own and program it into the Harmony. The software is deceptively complex. If you have a basic system then set up will be simple. But there are many many settings that can be adjusted by going deeper into the software.

Bad:
Software design - as pointed out elsewhere, the more you use the software the slower it gets until it bogs down your entire system. I have 512 of ram. Maybe this isn't an issue if you have a gig or so.

Manual - there isn't one. Given the depth of the software there should be some way to know what settings there are without using trial and error.

Remote design - This is really the most important issue since the software  won't be used much after the remote is set up. Most of the remote keys have the same feel so it's hard to operate without looking at it. Most of the remote keys are small and very slippery so it's hard to operate them even if you know which key to press. The remote itself feels like it's made of teflon - it's alway slipping around in your hand. In fact, sometimes it feels like you need 3 hands to operate it - 2 to hold it down and a third to press the button. The play/pause/ff/rw buttons on the very bottom, which is uncomfortable. These buttons should have been above the numeric section, not below. 

Overall:
Amazing software capability but the remote is uncomfortable

Don't you hate having to use 3 different remotes to watch a DVD or listen to a CD? Wouldn't it be nice to just press one button and that's it? Well, this remote does just that! Press "Watch a Movie" and the DVD Player turns on, the AV Receiver turns on (and switches to the correct setting) and the TV switches to the correct input. A real pleasure to use! 

Setup is simple. The Logitech website wizard walks you through the process. All you do is provide the make and model of your various components and what you want to happen during which activity. Everything is downloaded into the remote via the included USB cable.

The one small problem is everyone in your family has to get into the habit of always using the remote to turn things on and off. If your wife physically turns the TV off with the TV's On/Off button then the Activity buttons don't work properly (although the Help button quickly fixes the problem with a walk-through). 

If you have any Technophobes in your household, then this remote is a must. Highly recommended!

This remote is absolutely amazing! Set up is easy and fast. I was a little worried it would control my home theater system, because it is one of the all in one systems. Nope. It found it and controls it perfectly. My wife loves this remote because all she has to do is push one button to do what she wants. No more going through a series of remotes to do what you want. I was even able to customize the settings to get the remote to suit my taste. I can't think of anything bad. If you have a complicated media center in your home, get this remote now

I was pleased with both remotes although on one the channel and volume buttons died but Harmony in their wisdom decided to eliminate the TV listings on all their models out of the blue
I called customer support and the representative told me they were no longer providing that service and although she admitted receiving numerous complaints had no intention on restoring it.
With that kind of attitude and lack of support i DO NOT recommend any Harmony product.

This unit performs flawlessly. I too was disappointed to see that some of the functions required drilling down through layer upon layer of menus ... Till I figured out that you can easily remap the menu position of your most used functions. I had a couple of other issues as well, but they were a result of not following directions precisely. I have a ReplayTV model 5040 and it handles that perfectly. Every product has the occasional lemon, but I suspect that the people having problems are, for the most part, suffering from the results of 'Operator Error'. I was in a bind and paid twenty bucks more because I needed the unit right away, and I STILL feel like I got MUCH more than my moneys worth

These remotes are totally awesome.  The products are so good that the Harmony company was purchased by peripherals leader Logitech.  The software works great, web-based configuration is simply genius and support is top notch.  They make a whole line of remotes so you can pick the one that's perfect for you.  This is a great entry level model if you want to stop using multiple remotes with your home theater system.  Don't bother looking any further - the value here is unmatched

I am amazed and outstandingly pleased with the H-659. I can not think of anything more this remote could do in contolling my T.V., Tivo and Audio Receiver. Much is done by simply using one button. Being completely computer illiterate, I appreciate the courteous manner I was treated by Harmony's service people.

Don't believe a remote control could be worth as much as this costs?  Neither did I, until a few weeks ago.  It takes some time to program - mostly finding the serial numbers on all your electronic equipment and figuring out exactly what settings everything needs to be on - but once that's set up, it works very well.  I have mine controlling a tv and dvd/speaker system, and I set one up for my parents that controls their tv, dvd player, cd player, cable box, and vcr.  It's particularly good when you have relatives who are not, shall we say, technologically adapt, as you can switch between various functions with literally one press of the button

Liked the Pharos very much and I use it with my IPAQ 5550.  My only base reference is the Magellen Hertz never get lost that I have used twice earlier which was very good.
Pros:
1. No connectivity problems, easy to connect.
2. Splitter to charge both units at the same time.
3. Nice options and modes. The bird's eye view, tho' not graphically that attractive, serves the purpose and is even nice to show off.
4. Not bad at all as a personal GPS. Was pretty useful to me in SFO downtown and in NYC to get my bearings.  Store all your points in advance, use the multi-point feature and an Extended battery pack.

Cons:
1. Auto reroute takes a bit of time. If you miss a highway exit at 65mph it will start to auto-reroute after a mile.  Not good if there are close exits.
2. The map software -Ostia- is not as bad as mentioned in previous reviews -I found it pretty good- misses specific street level maps.. Very rare, nothing that cannot be rectified by a later update.
3. Sometimes, u exit from a highway and since the road may be going close to the highway, it takes a while to figure out that one is not on the highway anymore.  But possibly true of all GPS devices.
4. Maps are just huge and you will need a 4GB card if you go out for a long road trip and your laptop to transfer the maps. (Full US maps is 35GB) Probably true of all mapping software

Right on accuracy.  Ostia software has it's ups and downs but all the GPS units take some getting used to.  The biggest issue is how to enter your destination. Ex.  North Seneca St. or N. Seneca St. or Seneca St, N.  Eventually you figure it out.  No problem w/the blue tooth and my HP IPAQ 4705 works well with it but at times when restarting you may have to do a soft reboot.  For approx. $300 you can't go wrong.  Make sure you get the new Ostia Software version 7.  The updates should be worth it.  I especially like the auto re-route if you miss the right turn.  It really does get you there within 3 meters

I have used both this bluetooth model and the older cabled one with my iPaqs (3600, 3800, and 5555). The bluetooth model works like a charm with my 5555. I have never lost connection between the iPaq and the GPS, However the software (mapping program) is without a doubt a piece of junk. I have talked with a Pharos tech and he aqreed that is not very user friendly. It is like they finished making the GPS device and then said oh oh we need a mapping program and just threw one togeather.

Definitly buy this device but wait for MS Streets and Trips next version which is suppose to support Turn by Turn voice commands on the PocketPC's. (heck they might even package the pharos with the software. Hint Hint. Nudge Nudge)

These speakers are great. They will honestly make your music sound better. Also, they are quite small and don't take up much space. The volume touch buttons allow you to easily control the volume and also allow for a wide range of volume (plus they are fun to touch). I'm not very knowledgable in the world of speakers, but I did do a fair amount of research before buying these, and I'm definitely not the only one who thinks they're worthwhile. I live with three other people and we all have them, if that's any incentive. I highly recommend them

Absolutely great sounding speakers for their size and cost.  Great for a room and computer setup.  They get loud but not loud enough for a party or a full movie experience but perfect for a bedroom, apartment or dorm room.

They look great and have big bang for the size.  

Only con is that the little satelites have green lights that always stay on and the power button is on the back of the sub. Not ideal but doesn't make a difference to me but for the super power conscience might worry about that extra watt each night..

#1 Very little power. Hooked up to my ipod through the headphone jack with the volume maxed on both you can't make out much from across the room. 
#2 My set picks up a constant radio signal very faintly, so I have Hot 97 playing all the time. When I'm playing a podcast from my ipod I can still hear that radio underneath it. Not cool.
#3 Very difficult to access the power button (hidden in the back between two plugs). Esentially impossible if you hide the large subwoofer on the floor. JBL must have stock in an electric company.
#4 Small bright lights on the bottom of the speakers that you can't disable. Maybe that's a bonus for somebody.
I haven't really tried too many mini computer speakers. I use powered edirol monitors for my computer, so perhaps these JBLs are good for what they are, but man, they still suck

I have read all the other reviews for this product and find them to be good.  The only thing I did not see is the fact that you can split the connection to the system with a simple head phone splitter from radio shack.  Don't worry if both audio inputs are on at the same time the thing won't blow up.
This just makes it easier to hook up multiple items to the audio system

I bought these speakers specifically to go with my IPod and to be used in my office.  They work great.  I also have a Bose SoundDock at home and I honestly have to tell you I think that the Creature II's sound 95% as good as the Bose at a fraction of the cost.  I like them so much that I bought a second pair for our vacation home.  The only draw back is that some people might not like the design.  The Bose unit is cleaner and easier to just set on a shelf.  I don't think that you will be disappointed if you buy Creature II's

I was looking for a speaker system for my iPod for my office.  I have the 30 gig Viedo iPod.  I tried the iBoom, but returned it due to the volume level not going low enough.  This CTA system is AWESOME!  The audio quality is very good for the size of the system.  The enclosures are 90% aluminum...not plastic.  The only complaint I have is the power cord is not long enough...its about 3 feet long...so I cant really put it where I wanted to until I get an exension cord.  The remote is very handy - it has volume, bass, treble, skip back and forward, stop, pause/play, mute, random and repeat.  Great product!!

When I was looking for an accessory for my office to play my Ipod, I needed something compact, affordable, nice looking, and with great sound. These two speakers product huge amounts of sound that are great. The overall footprint of the unit is so small it takes up almost no desk space. I love the remote so I can control my music from across the room. I do wish the remote would let you control the playlists and menus, but then again, you couldn't see the screen from across the room. Overall it's a great unit, affordable, and with great sound

These headphones produce nice sounds, isolate noise well and would be great if it wasn't breaking apart and I'm using super-glue to hold it together.

Had these headphones for a while now and love them since day one for the great sound, but the plastic headpiece holding the adjustable connecting extensions are literally breaking apart. I had to super-glued the left side so that I may continue using them a couple of months back and now I'm gluing the right side as well. These headphones are only used in the office so it's not like it was crushed in a backpack or something, only been behind my monitor since I bought them. I would recommend anyone considering these headphones to reconsider

When I bought these headphones, it was not because I wanted the best sound quality. Instead, I wanted sound isolation so I could do work inside my room without disruptions. For this purpose, these headphones were the best, because I could not hear anyone talking to me (to a certain extent). 

However, if you want to buy the best headphones with the best sound quality, I suggest that you aim for the open head phones, the sound is better. The 280s have awesome sound quality as well, but my $40 Icemat headset matches the quality

If you don't know anything about sound, don't need qaulity headphones, aren't willing to do the research on why this is such a good set of headphones, don't have a preamp, or just want them because they're "top of the line", don't buy them.

If you really need to hear everything that's going on in your sound equipment and music, and I'm talking about every nuance, then these are what you want.  I can't speak for how they'll hold up against professional grade mastering monitors, but if you want the big guns, you'll need the cash.

Also, these headphones don't have as much bass kick as some other sets I've used.  But they have enough for anyone's needs, unless you like subs taped to your ears.  We're talking about quality sound with these, not quantity

I listened to a friend's pair and was blown away by the clarity and balance of these phones.  The additional isolation you get from listening to this closed design is remarkable; no modern active sound cancellation here, just plain old fashioned sonic isolation.  They are quite comfortable as well.  I am very happy with this purchase

I bought these because I wanted a good pair of headphones that I could wear at work.  Most high-end headphones are open-air nowadays.  Arguably they sound better, but others can definitely hear them.  I'd invariably end up disturbing my co-workers.  These headphones are very quiet once they're fit around your head.  I can have my music turned up pretty loud before they're even audible within 5 feet.

Like other reviewers, they were a little tight at first.  Gently bending them wide helps, but really it just takes some time to break them in.  After about 10 weeks or so of wearing them for a few hours each work day, they feel really, really comfortable.

They sound amazing, particularly for the price.  They're not going to be able to compete with really high-end headphones, but with these you'll definitely hear much, much more than you were hearing with your $20 cheapos.  A great purchase, a great value

The 512 stick, which I use as my backup memory stick, is completely awesome.

It is the 3rd stick I purchased for my semi-professional Sony H1, and my older Sony DSC-P52. The 512 wasn't quite big enough for filming video at 30 frames per second. (about 6 minutes worth) so I went out and bought the 1 gig as well. 

I am amazed at how fast it processes, and how fast it formats. Formatting is instantaneous.

If you shoot video at 30 fps, and can afford it, go for the 1 gig or even higher. Otherwise, the 512 is unbeatable.

Very difficult to lock and unlock--I have to hold my MacBook Pro on edge to get a grip on the lock while I spin the wheels.  Also the mechanism used to set new combinations is a lever that flips very easily.  In locking or unlocking the lock, it is all too easy to inadvertently set a new combination.

I have no gripes with the security the device provides, but it is basically unusable.  Very frustrating

I bought this lock for my laptop at school.  After locking it to my desk, it would not unlock.  I couldn't figure out the new combination so I contacted Kensington, who said that they would reimburse me for a locksmith.  I ended up opening the part of the lock that stores the cable with a pair of scissors.  Once that part was opened I was able to easily remove the cable and unattach the laptop from my desk.  If I could do this, any idiot with a pair of scissors and five minutes would have been able to as well

As has been mentioned in several of the reviews for this product, the lock has a tendency to "forget" the combination you have set. On THREE occasions, I had to start at 000 and try each combination one by one until I reached the new "mystery" combination that the lock had set by itself.

If the manufacturer has already admitted this defect, Amazon should not carry this product

I bought the Kensington ComboSaver to secure my laptop at work. The product was easy to use and the combo easy to change. I used it for about a week, and then needed to change the combination. I set the correct combo, flipped the lever, set the new combo, and flipped the lever back. I then locked my notebook as usual. At the end of the day, I set the new combo and the lock would not unlock. I set the old combo and that didn't work either. Maybe I did something wrong? 

The kicker is that I got some regular wire cutters and was able to pretty easily cut through the security cable, nipping at it bit by bit for a few minutes. I was shocked it was that easy. Next, to detach the lock from my laptop I used a regular battery powered drill with a regular drill bit and drilled through the end of the lock. Within just 5 minutes the end of the lock came off and using some needle nose pliers I pulled of each of the rings. Voila!

The lock is hard to use, when you try to set the combination the numbers are very loose and the move around while you are trying to lock/unlock it.  I had mine for about 3 months and it broke, so my laptop was stuck and it couldn't move it :-

The sound quality of this headset has been great, both in the microphone and the earphones. However the little blue light on the mute switch of the headphones stopped working the same day of first use. Not a really important part of the product, but malfunctioned nonetheless. 

Overall satisfaction is above average. If you don't care about the light, then I would recommend this product

The sound quality is fine and the price is quite reasonable, but the headphones are much too tight for me, and I have a relatively small head. There is no way to adjust the tension and they need to be tight since they don't rest on the top of your head, but simply press upon your ears to keep from sliding down. Better headsets (of all kinds - look at what airline pilots wear) have a pad on top.
Not much fun to wear for extended periods; I'd look at someting else

I find this headphone/microphone set very good in quality of sound and other features, but it becomes uncomfortable for long use. I sometimes have to use it for conference calls or other calls in skype or google talk. Sometimes the calls extend beyond an hour. It gets painful during those times.
Other wise the quality of sound etx is very good

I have four of these, one for each member of my family.  Primarily, we use them for listening to DVDs and Internet broadcasts on our computers, as well as for Internet telephony.  I even got one for a partner who uses it for speech recognition on his computer.  I think they are terrific-high quality audio and an accurate, non-distorted microphone.  Although one of them was defective (the volume control did not work correctly), Amazon's response was first-rate.  They replaced it with no fuss, muss or bother (or cost, for that matter, since they paid for the UPS pickup).  I might still get a smaller set for travel.  Also, the cord is a little skinny and so is more prone to damage.  But otherwise, a nice unit and a good value

I have had mine for over 2 1/2 years. Im a painter I work with lots of loud machines all day, from my paint sprayer to the sander. these buds are very good. they are comfortable enough to wear all day I generaly work 8-12 hrs a day and use them for at lest 6-8 hrs. they have one of the best sounds i have had out of a headphone. I bought some boss ear buds a while back and that were over $100.00 but the sound difference was not worth the extra cash i forked out. the long cord can be anoying ive just learned to cary a small ruberband with me and tuck the extra into the pocket with my ipod.and if you wear the headpones with the wire behind your head it dosnt bother you at all. I dont know what people are saying about the wires rubbing and making noise. mine dont. you should buy them. save yourself some cash.

I've had a pair of EX71SL's for over a year, and the sound is great.  The bass is pronounced and is probably not suitable for true audiophiles.  However, it is just right for me.  I find the midrange and treble to be appropriate.

I have a pair of Grado SR-80 headphones, and a pair of Sony MDR-V6 headphones.  Each is a $100 conventional full-sized set of headphones, and yet I actually prefer the sound of the Sony earbuds.

The only problem I have is that the cord is far too short without the extension, and far too long with the extension.  (A free and extremely long extension cord comes with the phones.)  What were they thinking?  Also, the fact that the right ear's cord is so much longer than the left's is ridiculous.  Don't they have a focus group review these things?

I've been using these earbuds for several months now, and they're far better than the ones that come with the iPod. They're more comfortable, and there's so much more bass, although as everyone else pointed out you have to push them way into your ears to get the bass.

My pair has gone through the washing machine twice and the dryer once, and they still sound just as good as the day I got them! (I did have to glue one of the earpieces back together, though.) I thought I'd certainly destroy them by getting them wet, but these things are industrial strength

Once again I'm amazed at how the reviews were so highly in favor of this product.  These are terribly uncomfortable (for my ears) and don't really provide that great of listening experience. The frequency response seems muted until you use the largest possible "surrounds", and then they become distractingly uncomfortable.  But of course, this is just my experience, your mileage may vary, as they say.  Personally, I found my Apple iPod 'phones to be better

I was pleased with the price, happy with the time of delivery, and so far have had no issues with the quality of these headphones.  The sound quality is good on airplanes, when working out, and they do not fall out of my ears nor do they cause any discomfort

I am a mild audophile, and I love these headphones. They have great base response, treble, and isolation. If you listen to music on the bus on train while listening for your stop, don't get get these! You won't be able to hear a thing outside of the music

Like I said above, I am on my second pair of these.  The first pair made it over two years of daily 5 mile workouts on an eliptical crosstrainer.  Believe me they held up well considring they got sweat soaked almost every day of their life.  These phones really bring out the bass beat and are for the money some of the best sounding headphones on the market.  When this pair wears out, I will get some more.  They are light years ahead of the cheap foam covered earbuds in sound and comfort.  You don't even realise you are wearing headphones with these on

These are great earbuds. I have alswys used Sony DJ headphones in the past, and these are the first pair of buds I have purchased - I am impressed.

For the money, the sound quality is very good - full and well rounded with good bass and the treble is not too bright.

They are pretty comfortable in the ears, but it does take a little getting used to. The cord is rather thin and very flexible, but seems to be sturdy enough for most use. The included 'case' is a little tough to figure out, but could be good for keeping them clean in a purse or backpack.

Definitely recommended

I was hesitant about purchasing this case because of the bad odor complaints.  However, there really isn't another leather case made specifically for the Z22.  Well, I've been very happy with the case; there is no bad odor at all.  I like the fact that it zips closed so the Palm is protected when it's rolling around in my purse.  I can charge and sync while it's in the case, no problem.  It's not that hard to take out if you prefer.  The power button is covered while in the case; but it isn't that hard to turn it on.  The case works very well for me.

I bought both. 
 
Everyday Case is bigger, it's like a wallet on a leash. 

Everyday Case probably protects it better because it zippers up. 

Everyday Case looks a bit more profesional. 

The lipstick holder & mirror in the Everyday Case are just taking up space ... I would have preferred a slot for my license and a smaller loop for a pen. I would have been ok if it was a little thicker so they could have added a tiny notepad. A wallet/Palm case is a great idea!   

The thing I like the most about the everyday case is the LOOK! 

That being said ...  

I use the Flexi Case ... the white one ... I have something very similar in pink for my iPod! If you feel it is a snug fit ... it will loosen up a bit if you take it in and out of the case ... the thing is there is no reason to take it out of the case that I can think of ... unless you wanna change colors? 

The Flexi Case comes with screen protectors that have an outline on the back for several different Palms. You cut out the outline for the Z22 ... if you have scissors and can follow a line you will be fine. You peel and stick it onto the screen to protect the screen from scratches/damage.

You slide the Palm Z22 into the soft rubber-like case ... it's like putting the bottom sheet onto a bed. :o| 

Sure the screen on my Palm is looking a little scuffed ... but that is because I use it ALL of the time & just drop it into my purse when I'm done!! This set-up allows very easy access to the Palm!!  

As for the Everyday Case ... the ON botton is sort of underneath the piece of leather that holds it in the case and it is not an easy comfortable feel to turn it on ... I could also see it accidentally getting turned on. I am not certain if you are meant to use it in the case ... but the cut-outs on the piece of leather that hold the Palm in the case lead me to believe you aren't meant to routinely remove it ... it just looks uncomfortable to use while it's in the case ... at least if you are holding it ... I imagine if it's sitting on a desk it would be fine.       

The flexicase is thin enough at the point of the ON button to make it feel natural using. 

Also the flexicase is a one handed case ... you could easily use it in your hand.  

I will use the Z22 much more with the Flexicase but I can see using either one as the needs arise? 

If you are looking for easy access ... a case that is utilitarian .... if you reallly wanna use your Palm hassle-free ... and you dont mind the scuffs on the screen saver ... I suggest the flexicases. 

If you are all about looks ... the everyday case might be a better bet. 

The Everyday Case was almost $10 cheaper to buy here on Amazon .... even with the S&H. I got the Flexicases at Circuit City for a little cheaper than here ...      

Happy Palming ....

I just purchased this case as well as the Z22.  Mine closes, I have 3 credit cards on one side of the flip, school ID's on the other side of the flip.  I have also placed my money ($70) in the back pockets (behind the credit card flap).  AND YES ... I have my lipstick in that stupid little loop.  It closes, my palm is not smashed.  The Palm doesn't slide out, I resync without taking it out of the case. AND to turn it off ... just push the button (through the leather).  I have mine set so that its not activated when the screen is touched.  I gave it 4 stars, because I wish it came in other colors.  :-

I just purchased a new Palm Z22 and definitely wanted a nice compact carrying case.  This was perfect.  It's a suede leather, small (only the size of the Palm, but thicker) and has a wrist strap.  It zips closed so I don't need to worry about velcro attaching to everything in my bag.  The Palm Z22 fits perfectly in it. The case has a mirror, although not a good one, but I didn't really need one, so I stuck the "graffiti" coding sheet to it.  I haven't filled it with credit cards or anything.  Probably just put some of my business cards in there.  I know it didn't have good reviews previous to mine, but they may have had different needs.  I like that it was made specifically for the Z22

This driver is excellent!  Definitely a plug and play solution, didn't/doesn't/hasn't crashed windows and when my system shut down due to power failure, the driver picked up where it left of with my transfer, not losing any data.  I would purcase another and would also recommend it to friends and colleagues.

I've always been a Seagate fan, so we bought this for our office backup. Do not do as we did and rely on it as your only backup. Despite excellent care and almost never being moved, ours crashed after 2 years. It would cost at least $100.00 to recover the data. We're not only not buying another one, we're never buying another Seagate anything

I am satisfied with this Hard Drive. XP recognized it right away, and it is very quiet. Highly recommended. My only gripe, and 
I understand the Fat32 format is common on USB Drives, but why cannot they be formatted in NTFS? I was told by Seagate of a way to do this however, when I tried their method, a window appeared to the effect that if I continued the Drive could be become unuseable

I bought this drive to back-up my desktop and laptop PCs.  USB connection was a snap and moving files onto it didn't take too long at all.  That's includes about 50GB of video media files!

As for daily wear, I have no answer as it is back in its box until next month's back-up

Once out of the package, was installed in about 90 seconds with no issues on my old Windows XP machine.

My first task was moving 6GB of video files onto the new drive.  Transfer took less than 6 minutes (over 1GB / minute).  I was able to play / navigate high quality video files directly from the external drive without any noticeable frame drop or seek lag.  Basically could not tell the difference between this drive and my internal system drive!  The small cashe size does not seem to hamper any of these tasks.  

NOTE:  I have not attempted to record video directly onto the drive, but given the performance I have seen it would probably be OK.....although it probably would be best to always record to the internal drive and use the external as overflow space.


Pro:
-Easy set-up
-Almost totally silent
-Much faster performance than expected
-Runs cool  (unlike many other portable drives)
-Inexpensive  (paid $99 locally)

Con:
-Heavy / unstylish paperweight  (do you care?)


Benefits:
-Now have enough room to defragment my existing system drive again!
-Extends the life of old machine
-Will make data migration to future machine much easier
-Can now gather more video files before being forced to edit, burn DVD, and dispose of the source files

I was a little hesitant to buy this case due to the reviews, but I'm very happy with it. It's the perfect size and has space for everything I use with my iPod. I received what I believe is a newer version than the current picture for this item... there are no cd sleeves - they have been replaced by credit card sleeves and the case looks more like a standard organizer - the left size has a flap to organize things like papers, and a long padded pocket for potentially holding a checkbook or other items. Even the sleeve for the iPod itself is different and has just one open space for the clickwheel and if you have them, the four buttons on earlier models. I have the 60G iPod with video and the case I received is even better than what I thought I would get. The Monster car charger and splitter are very nice looking and work well. I highly recommend this case!

I am going to get this and have seen some bad reveiws and i want to stranten something out, " IT IS NOT GOING TO WORK UNLESS YOURE SYSTEM IS COMPATIBLY, so check your system compatabilty since most likely if your buying it your system is melliniem or below and it won't work with the minimum either i have a 95 and i used some new hardware on it and my 95 met the minimum combatibility but didn't, so make sure youre above the combatability.

Hi , I am ranjeet here , writing a review for this IOGear USB 2.0 PCMCIA port. I have heard a very bad review abt this product on amazon , but let me tell all those review are totally wrong abt this product, i bought this product with a fear in my mind whether it will work or not on my Toshiba laptop, but hey it worked instanesously without any problem as soon as i plugged it in and i was very happy to see my external dvd burner worked exactly as i tought . I bought this because my laptop was having 1.1 usb port and i needed usb 2.0 port badly and i thought i will try this product as its below $50 price , this product is not only compatible with lots of things, its works with my canon digicam , my web cam , my usb mouse . its perfect and excellent without any doubt . great product and i am statisfied too .

Wow, I was suprised to read all the bad reviews.  I bought this needing a 2.0 USB port since my laptop is 2 1/2 years old...my music tranfer rate to my IRIVER H10 is speedy.  As Far as support...I haven't need it, so I 'll give this a FULL STAR Rating

My husband loves this walkman. Found it to be very well made, sound is excellent. He is out hiking every day, and he has had no problems with this walkman. We would like to order another, but it seems to be currently out of stock, although we did see it on the Sony website. No negatives whatsoever!

I did not receive the product ordered, was given the runaround regarding a refund and still have not gotten my money back. The Etronics customer service reps have called me "arrogant" for demanding my money back over two months after the order was supposed to arrive. This was a Christmas present - how embarassing.

I am totally pleased with the Sony Headphone Radio.  I am an electrical engineer and have designed receivers for many years.  No FM receiver can receive FM without being subjected to multipath distortion caused by reflection of FM signals from metal structures or fading due to movement of the antenna.  Both of these situations cause reception to fade in and out as you turn your head or walk.  This radio works as well as any I have ever used and probably as well as is technically possible.

The AM performance is governed by the size of the antenna.  Since the antenna must be small in a headphone receiver, the received signal will be much less than that of a car radio for example.  However, I am able to receive AM stations as well as any similar product I have ever used.

I am also impressed by the headphone audio quality and the double headband used to keep the radio/headphone in place as you move.

Overall, I am very satified with this product.  And if you recognize the technical limitations of a small receiver with a moveable antenna, then you will be as impressed with this product as I am

This radio works great.  I work in a warehouse at night and like to listen to both talk radio on AM and fast rock music on FM to keep me going all night.  I get great reception in 90% of the warehouse which is as good or better than anything else I've tried.  The batteries last about 2.5 weeks (4 days a week, 8-12 hours a night)

I use these while gardening and walking in my neighborhood, as well as while my husband is around (he doesn't like to listen to the radio).  

They're generally pretty good.  The automatic presets work well and are easy to memorize and use without removing the headphones from your head.  The built-in clock is handy, and batteries generally last for a long time.  They are fairly lightweight and comfortable to wear.

Minuses:  the reception varies quite a bit.  Near dense walls, both AM and FM will cut out temporarily; you have to move or turn your head to get reception back.  FM is particularly sensitive.  Close to walls, I often lose an FM station whose transmitter is less than 5 miles away.

For the money, this is a solid little pair of headphones with good multiple uses

I researched for a portable AM/FM radio to use while doing cardio at the gym.  I settled on the Sony because it had all the features that I was looking for.  Also,the reviews I read online were pretty good.  I purchashed the radio and was somewhat disappointed in the reception.  I was unable to get a local FM station that I really like to listen to and also at the gym, there were several of the TVs broadcasting FM signals that I could get clearly.  At first I thought it was the TV causing the problem, but after working the staff, it was determined that it was my radio, since other radios were able to get the broadcast clearly.  I just worked around these irritations.  Then about a week ago (the radio was about 11 months old) the AM station I was listening to just quit.  At first I thought the station was having a problem.  I switched to FM and it was working.  When I switched back to AM, it was still not playing.  Finally, after moving around, I was able to get the station, but was not able to hear it clearly, lots of static.  Over the next few days, the problem drifted from the AM to FM and back to AM.  The radio is not very unreliable.  I contacted Sony and worked through potential options to fix the problems.  I replaced the batteries and reset all the presets (Sony's correction procedure).  None of these really helped the problem.  Sony then said since it was less than a year old, I could get it exchanged.  Well when I got the form to fill out for the exchange, I found out they were going to charge me $24 to get a refurbished radio.  That is pretty outrageous, considering that it cost only $39 when I purchased it new.  I told Sony, why would I want to buy another one since the first one lasted less than a year.

I am very disappointed in the product and Sony.  I would not recommend this product at all.  I am now doing research again to find another radio, but it will not be a Sony !

I use the radio indoors at a health club. The reception is terrible. When you turn your head, you lose the signal. Whoever did the interface design on this product needs mentoring by a hign level industrial designer. The on/off switch on the back of one of the headphones slides between the on and off postions. Unfortunately, when you carry the radio in your gym bag, the fabric rubs on the switch and the radio turns on. When it is time to use the radio again, the batteries are dead and your station presets have been erased. Setting the presets is a totally counter-intuitive experience.  It can't be done without the instructions, a copy of which I have to keep in my gym bag. To preset the station, you have use some very small mode and enter buttons. The function of each button is printed on the headphone in  a font that is so small and in a shade of gray that provide very little contrast with the darker gray surfaces on which the functions are printed that it is almost impossible to read the function information. When the audio is working, the quality is great. But it is very frustrating to use this radio. I owned the previous Sony model of thih radio for years and loved it. It worked great and was very easy to use and program. I bought this model without looking at it very carefully expecting that it would be better, or at least as good, as the previous model. But Sony disappointed me this time. I can't put up with this radio anymore. I am looking for a replacement

I am still in search of the perfect radio/headphone set-up for the gym.  I thought this would be the answer.  But the reception inside my gym was terrible.  Trying to listen to NPR's Morning Edition, I got more static than anything else.  If I moved my head in various directions, it would come in clearer but how annoying is that!  Especially when you're trying to run on the treadmill.  So back it goes.  Very disappointed

Like most of the reviewers here I found the Receptor to be an excellent sounding and thoughtfully designed clock-radio.  

My major complaint is that it does not allow you to assign a radio station to be used as the alarm music. Instead it uses the last station the radio was tuned to. This is a feature found on much cheaper clock-radio's and I miss being able to set a different station to each alarm and/or listen to one station at night and wake up to another

 I chose this radio primarily for superior sound and good reception.  It exceeds expectations.  The reception is clear and crisp in huge contrast to my old Sony.  No fidgeting back and forth anymore with a chinsy dial.  the digital tuning is sure and clear.  Every station on the dial is coming in crisply in this metropolitan area.  The sound is wonderful; full and rich.  I barely turn up the volume; plenty in reserve.  But the volume is easily controlled with a smooth knob.  I agree that it is a tad bit bassy at low volume but that gives it the fullness of sound.  The bonus is the elegant simplicity of the design.  The buttons are layed out nicely, and the pre-set programming on the knob is great. Easy to set, you can have all your stations on one knob; even switching bands so you can have the ball game on there too from your AM dial. And you can put them in the order you like, as it puts them in the order you set them, not numerical order of the frequency.  I think this is better design than even the row of small preset buttons on some other models. The numbers might be a pinch smaller than average, but the problem is with my eyes not the radio. Its not too bright; there are 2 brightness settings, lo and hi.  The dual alarm, i thought unnecessary, but I have found it a convenient feature for a weekend alarm without having to reset. Though re-setting time and alarm is a breeze with the one knob, rather than teeny H and M buttons, held simultaneously.  My one "con" is that I always found with other clocks when you used a radio/buzzer setting, it would return to radio play when you hit the snooze at the buzzer.  This one turns off entirely for 10 minutes, rather than keeping the radio on.  I find that odd and would have much preferred the excellent radio to keep me at least half awake.  ANT had a great price when I ordered.  I'm so glad that I treated myself to this awesome radio. And I disagree with the comment about the buzzer not being loud enough, it starts off reasonable but gets louder.  And the comment about not seeing the time if your listening to the radio is incorrect.  There is a button that lets you choose your preference.  It is right on top, not under the lid, so you can switch your preference easily any time you want. Just a press switches it back and forth.  Like I said,good design.   Less often used buttons are under a lid so you don't tap them accidently

The beauty in this radio is not only how it sounds, but how nicely it is engineered. They went out of thir way to keep it simple. Only buttons that are essential to it's operation are inlcuded. Once your presets are in, you don't even have to hit AM/FM. Just twist the left knob, and your all your stations pop up instantly. The alarm buttons are minimal and do exacty what they should (even if you're half asleep.) There is even a gently blinking light to let you know that the snooze is "cooking". That feature alone is woth the asking price.

Some people are trying to equate this one speaker mono radio to their home systems and that's a not a fair contest by any standard. For what it is, the sound is gorgeous. Yes, it is sometimes a tad boomy at low volumes, but anyone who's owned a classic tube hi-fi radio knows that - that is the small trade off for having great sound out of one speaker.

I'm very happy with this radio and I would highly recommend it to anyone who is sick of the button mania from which all modern clock radios seem to suffer

This is a superb unit with great ergonomics, excellent radio and clock functionality, and aesthetically pleasing size and design.

I chanced upon a unit on display at Target. Note I was not even looking for a table radio at the time. Upon a few minutes of listening, I knew I was hooked, and purchased immediately.

Even at $150, this unit is a bargain. Treat yourself to the warm, sweet sounds from Boston Acoustics engineers. AM dxer's note that the internal rod antenna can be easily disconnected for purpose of connecting external antenna (a rare and welcome option...somebody at Boston Acoustics is paying attention to design quality)

I bought this unit based on the great reviews it got, and when I went to use it, my C320 kept falling in my lap when I would accelerate.  Then I thought about how I mounted it on my dash, and realized I had it backwards.  

The Garmin name on the mount should face the driver.  The single foot goes towards the driver and the two feet towards the windshield.  I did it the other way initially, as I wanted the C320 closer to the driver.

I bought two C320s and have one mounted to the windshield with the enclosed suction cup mount and one in a second vehicle with this dash mount.  As noted, the dash mount is very portable, and has it's own included power cord.  It would be more cumbersome to move the suction cup mount into a different car, or to take with us on a trip to use in a rental car.

The only negative comments I can make are minor.  The C320 tends to vibrate a bit, up on the dash mount.  In addition, the screen of the C320 gets more direct and ambient light on the dash, than it does mounted by the rear view mirror.

Both mounts are working fine for now, and we are waiting to see if the windshield mount suction cup fails, as some people have commented on before we decide if we will purchase a second dash mount

I have 2000 Honda. It fits very well with the contoured dash. The suction mount was falling often with plate and also at winshield. This dash mount is low profile(not too high) and portable. Highly recommended for every c320,c330 and c340 Garmins

Dash-Mount is much better than the suction cup.  It moves easily from car to car (in our case, between the Astro-Van and the VW NB convertible).  It's easy to remove from the dash by picking it up.  Will not slide on dash unless you tip the car over.

I wish this mount was the standard mount and the suction mount was the optional.

PLUSes:

+ stays put
+ easily transfer from car to car
+ power cord stays attached to mount.
+ great price! here on Amazon.com

I am very glad I ordered this with my Streetpilot.  I didn't want to mount it on my windshield and this holds it securly on the dash.  I remove it from the dash if my vehicle is going to be parked for a long period of time and to keep it out of the sun when not in use this makes it easier to remove.  I consider it a must have item

My motivation to purchase this was not because it is illegal to windshield suction mount in CA, but because I wanted to be able to easily move between cars. Also, to be able to easily move it from the tempting dash location when parked to a less conspicous place. It works perfectly on both counts! I did put a bit of velcro under the center and also a spot on each dash as my driving is a bit spirited at times.

Highly recommended - actually Garmin should ship this, and not the suction mount, with the GPS unit

This handy little device solved my problems and allows me to use my Garmin GPS in a much easier fashion. It sits securely on the dashboard, but is flexible enough that I can leave it attached and stow the unit in my armrest console to prevent theft.

This is a super way to mount and use your GPS.  For security, we take it off the dashboard and put it on the floor when we park.  It holds the unit securely and safely.

Only concern is: In an accident will it go flying?  We have not had a problem after several months of use.

In California, no windshield inside mounts are allowed. The Garmin Dash mount solution addresses this problem very well. It sticks to the dash and does not slide about. It is a little on the heavy side but the weight helps hold it in place. In a hard frontal auto accident it would be tossed into the windshield so there is some collison risk to your StreetPilot(but to you too). It has many pluses- high build quality, holds the GPS firmly, can be easily moved between cars, and has a charging jack built in. The minuses are few- heavy, might not fit a sculptured dash found in some cars, and its a little awkward to carry. Overall I am impressed with it

This surge protector was recommended by several audio and home theatre internet sites. It's solid in construction and is aesthetically pleasing. There are three indicator lights that serve as a heads up as to wether the surge protector is working properly or not. The 10 outlets are labeled (DVD, Amp, receiver,CBL/SAT, etc.). It also comes with additional labels if you have two of any electronic device or do not like the label arrangment on the surge protector. The outlets are spaced out so its easy to fit as many as 6 transformers onto the surge protector. On the side of the surge protector are inputs for a phoneline and an internet line. The device also allows protection for up to three coaxial cables. The output Watt capacity is 1440 watts. This surge protector has allowed me to safely and adequately protect everything in my room. It is great if you want  to organize all the wires behind a desk or TV/audio stand. I am thoroughly impressed with the device and would recommend it to anyone

I set this adapter up on my Dell D610 (company won't buy them with native Bluetooth option!), and used the enclosed Bluesoleil software.  Worked like a charm 1st time.  I use it to tie my Plantronics headset to my Cisco IP communicator softphone as well as synching my Palm Tungsten E2.  I'm sure as I travel, I'll find more uses for this nifty toy

I purchased the TRENDnet Bluetooth USB adapter to get a bluetooth
headset I use for my cellphone to work on my PC as a Skype headset. 
It installed easily with the software and fully supports the 
headset.  It has worked without any problems.   I do get static
on the headset, but this is a general bluetooth problem not
related to this product.  I've tried other bluetooth USB
adapters and they didn't support the required profile for 
the headset.  This feature combined with the low price makes
this a good buy

The software included with the Trendnet adapter installed easily and appears to be very capable.  It took only seconds to pair my Win2000 PC with my Motorola e815.  I can use the software that came with the adapter to pull pictures off the phone.  It's easier than using Motorola's own software.  The software also allows for dial up networking with this phone.

Pretty impressive for such an inexpensive piece of hardware.

I PAID $250  (CLOSE OUT) AT BEST BUY, AND THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST CRT (NORMAL PICTURE TUBE TVs) I'VE OWNED. THE COLORS ARE VIBRANT WITHOUT THE SKIN TONES GOING "DAY-GLO". ONE OF MY FAV FEATURES IS NUMERICAL VALUES FOR EACH ADJUSTMENT(COLOR,BRIGHTNESS,ETC) , MAKING IT EASY TO FIND AN OVERALL SETTING, ESPECIALLY  WHEN YOU HAVE MULTIPLE CHANNELS: SATELLITE, CABLE,TV. (THE NEXT PRESIDENTAL ADDRESS FLIP AROUND AND NOTICE THE DIFFERENCE IN CHANNEL PICTURES)IF A CHANNEL OR MOVIE NEEDS ADJUSTING YOU CAN DO SO THEN PUT IT BACK LATER, NO PROBLEM! WITH A TV LIKE THIS YOU MAY WANT TO HOLD OUT ON SPENDING A LOAD ON ONE OF THE NEWER TYPES FOR A WHILE

I've had two of these televisions delivered; both of the them had cracked casings.  Toshiba doesn't use enough packing material in the boxes to protect them properly.  The second TV we received was packed upside down in the box.  If just one TV had been damaged, I would have considered it a fluke.    Amazon has been nice about the problem but it's not worth the hassle.  Next time I'm going to the store where I can see the TV I'm buying before I get it home

I purchased this television by accident; I had wanted a flat-screen, but the price was so great on this TV at the time, I failed to notice it wasn't a flat-screen until I got home. My error turned out to be a good thing, though. I absolutely love this television. I am able to hook up my DVD player, PS2, and Gamecube all at once. The picture-quality and the sound-quality are amazing. No complaints with the remote, either. Overall a wonderful television I plan to keep for a very long time

I've had one of these for the past several years, using it on and off when wireless wasn't an option.  It has served me well and I really like how compact and convenient it is to use.  I find the build sufficient but nothing that couldn't be destroyed with a hard knock.  When using it, one has to be sure that the cable isn't recoiling all twisted or else that would damage the auto-retract.  I haven't had a problem with the retraction yet.  I don't use the telephone adapter too often but in the rare cases that I needed it, I was very happy to have this product on hand.  It saves me from carrying an extra cable and the telephone cable is sufficient for times when Ethernet isn't an option.  The only thing I would want more from this product is a longer cable but I don't know how that would affect the size of the product.  6' is sufficient for most situations but I wouldn't mind an extra 4' or more.  I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to carry around a phone/ethernet cable without the bulk/inconvenience of carrying the regular cables.  It is functional and understand that it isn't built like a tank and it'll serve you well as it has for me

Note:  This is a review of the Targus PA225U Retractable Phone & Ethernet Cord (Plastic Casing).  It's the rectangular model, not the oval shaped one.

I'm on the road 50-75% of the time for work and have used this on almost every trip.  I initially bought it because I forgot my regular network cord while traveling and needed to buy something quickly.  I like to be able to move around in the hotel room and use this cord along with a cheap little plastic cable joiner to connect it to the hotel internet connection so I can sit on the couch or bed while connected to the internet.  I've experimented with a travel wireless router but keep coming back to the wired connection when the wireless connection has problems.  I've used it for over a year and have never had any problems with the retraction

If I leave my laptop somewhere I hate having to worry about tripping over wires and wires everywhere just look bad.  This is really small and compact! Perfect for traveling too.  I've used it for about 8 months now and it hasnt had one problem...it still recoils well

I am on my second one and I will be returning this one also. Both of them worked once and then would not retract fully after that. I was so mad I almost threw it against the wall. I thought the first one was a defect, but then when I got the second one I realized it was a design flaw... If you buy the Targus one keep your receipt because I guarantee you will be returning it. What I don't get is how Targus has the guts to release this product and also put on it: Satisfaction Guaranteed. What a joke..

The remote that came with the TV had died, so I ordered this replacement.  After putting in the batteries, it worked immediadely with my TV, VCR and DVD.  It even works with Gold Guide!  I will say, though, that all my components are RCA.
I'm going to order another one.

Im with the first reviewer. This unit will operate only some of the functions of each device. For ex: it wont switch my Toshiba TV's video input, this means you cant use this to switch between the cable/tv/dvd/HDTV inputs. On the cable box it wont show the guide, info or setup screens. This perplexes me and yes I tried EVERY code to see if it would work.

RCA website was not even useful.

Look elsewhere or get a programmable unit

I'm the guy everyone comes to, to program their VCRs, digital clocks, computers, etc.  (I'm a computer sysadmin professionally, so I'd like to think I could figure this thing out; not the case).  This remote does not work for me in several areas... it only works well with my TV, Sharp.  

I have a Samsung combo DVD/VCR which the remote half way works with, but will only change channels with, not power off or on or switch back and forth.  This item does not work at all with my brand new KLH audio entertainment system.  I would not be so upset, but the RCA website and phone numbers offer no support or information as to possible solutions, or lack there of, in a knowledgebase or something similar.  My plan is to return this unit and get the PhilipsMagnavox PM625S as suggested in another review.  

The remote does have a nice design, and works great with my TV.  This may be good for the person who has one major name brand new TV and one Major name brand new VCR and the same of a DVD or audio player... even then, it's risky.  Thanks, and good luck

I have gone through two Brother HL-1250 printers that use this cartridge and it's a real work horse.  I've printed as many as 900 or 1000 pages in one day and it just keeps humming along.  I once tried to refill the toner myself and that was a disaster...black pages started coming out!  And yes I did empty the old cartridge before refilling it.  Now I just buy the toner cartages.  Its nice to be able to print a big document without worrying about jams or spending a fortune...or having to load paper that often.  I now use the pre-punched paper and my printing is easy and cheap!  The cartridge gets about 5,000 to 6,000 pages and the drum unit gets about 25,000 pages... so cost per page not including paper is around 1.4 cents.  Not too bad.
Perfect for text and internet web pages ect. Pics come out good for a monochrome but nothing fantastic. Maybe its my HL-1250?  Graphic artist or people doing high end work or high volume printing may want something better... but for my 900 to 1,800 pages per month needs... its perfect

I have bought 3 of these and they work well. They are reliable and they print thousands of pages, although I have never done a count. I recommend this as an economical solution to quality monochrome printing that would work for home or office. I cannot recommend this product against generic or no-name versions, but I can confirm that it provides a very high level of quality for value when compared to HP and other more expensive printers

I Have been using Brother laser printers which use this cartridge for about 7 years. GREAT PRODUCT. In fact the Brother multi function machine I currently use is a (now discontinued) MFC 9600. It has now been replaced with the nearly identical MFC 9700. I have had it for some 5 years with regular use and it works flawlesly. I use about 3 or 4 TN460 cartridges per year. Brother seems to be about the only manufacturer which provides a decent economical value for laser toner. Yes their printers/multi function machines cost a little more initially, but, do the long term math. You pay dearly in toner costs down the road with other better known or more highly publisized brands. I am continually surprised when I inquire at any office supply store about the cost per print or cost of operation of any given laser printer. The sales people are baffled, and never seem to know. This to me is THE question to ask. And, with the cost a some excellent full featured heavy duty Brother multifunction machines (fax scanner laser printer) very close to $300, it really does not make any sense to buy anything else if you are a small business home office with fairly regular laser/fax usage. Yes you might get a laser printer for $100 less. But after a few cartridges, you will wish you had a Brother using this economical cartridge.

While it lacks the sleek look of the Apple Pro mouse, the 2 buttons and scroll wheel (also clickable) are all fully programmable with the Macally mouse driver. (The cost is a bit of processor time and memory.) Even without the driver installed, you do get left & right click and wheel scrolling, just not all the other choices. Right from the start it works with pretty much all applications, whether with or without the driver installed. (Running OS X, 10.4.2 on a G4 iMac)
The shape is also slightly more comfortable in the hand than the Apple mouse; all that's missing is the look

I love Macs--I am a Mac user for life for the main reason that PCs just don't even come close to the same level of quality and interface control that a Mac has.  My Apple Pro Mouse broke (not a defect, I broke it), and I wasn't about to shell out $50 for a new one.  What I did instead was research Macally and got a much better mouse for much less money.

The one problem I have is that Apple still insists on the whole single button mouse thing.   The Macally Mouse is better because it has the two button setup, which (sorry Apple) is just better.  It is better for gaming and it is better for contextual menus.

It is still an optical mouse just as the Apple Pro Mouse is, which is such a vast improvement over the track ball design that its not funny (yeah--no more picking clogged dog hair out of the mouse!)

Also, because it is the iceMouse, it is colored to go well with all the new Apple iMacs, eMacs, iBooks, and Power Books.  If you use an older model, colored iBook or iMac, you should check out the Macally Scroll Mouse with the changeable faceplates.

The Macally Mouse also has a scroll wheel, which I had always thought was a dumb idea until I had one.  It is amazing how fast you get used to using the scroll wheel for word processing and web surfing, to point and click quickly without using the window scroll bar.

I have two, and I can tell you that it works great both as a replacement mouse for my eMac and as a alternative to the touchpad on my iBook.  All of these facts mean two things.  First, Apple should make the Pro Mouse more like the Macally Mouse.  Second, until they do change, you should switch to the Macally Mouse

I miss the bass on these. I know they are not headphones or speakers but when I listen to a Bach Organ Tocatta I expect bass. These did not deliver even I tried to deeply insert them in my ears. They others might artificially elevate the bass. These just don't seem to make it. Also, the bass in a band is felt in more than the ears so you don't need to have bass as much in headphones when in a band as when doing something else. 

3 stars
1 week later later
I am getting use to the earphones. I do not know who needs breaking in me or them. They are definitely the clearest sounding pair. I still miss the bass and mid range but less now. They take more care in regards to putting them on then the old pair I have. I am not quite happy with the price. It seems a little high. But I am beginning to like the earphones better. 
I am looking at the e500pth pair. The shure e500pth has 1 tweeter and 2 woofers; one more than this pair. This should help in regards to better mid-range and bass, I hope.  

2 days later
 Finally received the e500pth. This earphone does have the lower frequencies. Also, it fits my ear better than the e5c. The PTH option make a neat microphone with the AAA battery installed. I am finally happy with the E500PTH. I would say if you are ready to drop the cash for these I might actually go for the E500PTH. It is definitely a better sounding device. There was good reason to add the second woofer to the earphone.

This headset lives up beyond what it promises, its an absolute dream to have owned these, despite its expense I bought two just to make sure that I always will be carrying one when I need one.

The best qualities include
1. Perfect noise cancelling qualities you might be lost in your music or movie so be careful of social implications ;))
2. Simple yet Durable and fashionable design, No one is going to believe they cost over 400$$++ therefore the chances of someone not knowing about these going to actually steel these are low unlike other expensive designer headsets.
3. Wires are so superb you can pull rotate yet they are super solid.

The only disadvantages, I encountered are that,
1. The ear pieces may not suite all year sizes, I had initial problem getting them into stay inside my ears comfortably, since the introduction of the new flange's they sit in superbly.
2. Because they fit in so well, you may have difficulty taking them in and out to listen to others from time. Due its inner-ear seating, even without it being connected it cancels out a lot of noise as if you are wearing ear plugs.
3. It would have been quite advantages if SHURE had included airline connector to travel in economy class in first class quality. ;)

I've owned all kinds of reference-quality headphones in the past. While the E5Cs are, in terms of sound quality, not superior to the best Sennheiser or Grado headphones, these are as close "to being there" as you can get with an in-ear design and they have phenomenal fidelity for an in-ear design while also blocking almost all outside noise.

The bass is full-bodied, the treble is as clear but not too bright, and the overall frequency response is very well balanced. The E5Cs are significantly better than the E4Cs, which I've also owned. The bass of the E4Cs is simply not on a par and is a far cry from what the E5Cs will deliver.

If you want to listen to MP3s with them, be prepared to hear compression artifacts which won't be apparent with lesser headsets. Use at least 192kbps sampling rate.

In case you're interested in how these compare to the best of Active Noise Cancelling headsets - the E5Cs are better. I frequenly use the Bose Quiet Comfort 2 - my favourite travelling accessory until I got these. The Bose headset also has an excellent sound (albeit not as well balanced as the E5Cs - it seems to me they've designed it to be more 'fun' to listen to with bass and treble emphasized). However, the QC2 active noise cancellation is not as good as the 'plug effect' from the E5Cs and does not cancel the high-pitch frequencies of, for instance, a jet engine as well. If you want that, get the Bose Aviation Headset X - excellent noise cancellation, excellent sound, but a little bulkier than the E5Cs...

Build quality of the E5Cs is great too - and they're backed by an excellent product warranty. 

If you can afford the price, buy a set - I can recommend these wholeheartedly

I was skeptical about how good these could possibly be. Shure makes some awesome stuff, they are considered in the highest regard by all the musician friends I have, but this much money? For Earbuds? Come on Shure.

I had owned two pairs of E2c's, and a pair of E3c's. All had fallen victim to accidents of some sort that were either beyond my control, or somebody else's fault. Shure's warranty and customer service is top notch, but I certainly can't be mad at them for not replacing something that was blatantly broken because of stupidity.

Anyways, with my previous Shures, I was impressed. So I took the dive on the track record I had with Shure and went for the E5c's when it came time to get new earphones for the iPod. And I am glad I did. I am hearing things I never heard before, amazing clarity, just mind boggling, I actually caught myself drooling when listening to a blues album. I never thought I'd get such amazing sound out of my iPod ever. The price is worth it. I thought about it too, we spend tens of thousands on cars, but their performance is ultimately limited by the rubber that hits the road. We spend hundreds on the iPod, but stick cheap earbuds in our ears? If you want great sound, pay the price, good tires that really show the potential of the car are expensive. Amazing headphones that really show the potential of your music are the same way.

If I had only one complaint it would be this. The amount of music my iPod will hold is going to drop. I formerly had all my music encoded at 192kbps. I now find myself going through all my albums I have the hard copy to still, meaning the CD. And re-importing them. Re-importing them in Apple Lossless audio file, which is about 600-1200kbps. It's variable, some of the older Ray Charles I listen to is lower, like 690kbps, but some of the newer stuff, like John Mayer "Continuum" or Gnarls Barkley "St. Elsewhere" is north of 900kbps, the first track on St. Elsewhere goes over 1100kbps. But the quality is amazing. You can hear the musician breathing, the strings being plucked and fingered, pianos sound real. It truly makes the music sound like you're live in the studio, and it's occurring in your head. It's a life changing experience, I will never listen to music the same. The only downfall, is that this high quality encoding takes up more space. Where before I had thousands of songs on my 30gig iPod, I now find my estimates for importing putting me in the ball park of just over 215 albums. Does it kind of stink that I can only fit about 3000-ish songs on my 30gig iPod now? Yeah, that's kind of a downer, I don't have the plethora like I did before on hand. But, that said, I will gladly exchange the amount for the quality. Quality over quantity right? I didn't have to make this choice, I could have left everything at 192kbps and been happy. But the difference is night and day.

Do I recommend these? Yes, to the serious music fan. The person who uses them on their media player with lossless music, importing only complete albums. If you are a person who downloads and you find your library floating in the 128-192kbps area, get some E2c's or E3c's, whichever fits your budget. But if you demand the best, and you want the best, and you are willing to pay for it. This is the way to go.

I'll never go back to anything else, never. I will keep my E5c's until they cease to work and Shure won't do anything about it because it'd be like taking a Model T into a Ferrari dealership for warranty work. Which is understandable. At which case I will upgrade to whatever Shure's current model line replacement for the E5c's is

I have a collection of headphones and earphones, for running, walking, driving, the house (and the rest of the family).  These I bought about a year ago, and I've used them for 100s of hours driving, walking, and when the family was occupying both my sets of big Sennheisers.

I use the foam sleeves, which are by far the easiest to insert properly in the ear canals, although there are claims that some of the flimsy plastic sleeves are slightly more sound-transparent.  Count on getting a supply of replacement foams and switching them every month or so with heavy usage (especially if your kid should wash her ears more).  Replacement is easy and each pair is one or two dollars.

Pros
(1)  To me, the sound is excellent, but not so different from the Shure E3c's (~$150) now relegated to my daughter's use.  Technically, these have dual speakers on each side coming out of the same port, one for the high frequencies and one for the bass, while the E3c's have just one.  Apparently, there are still fancier Etymotics with 2 speakers with two different ports.
(2) These look good, the clear plastic nearly invisible, and sort of Matrix-techy.
(3) I've been moderately rough with these, stuffing them in my pockets and sitting on them, with no problems.

Cons
(1)  The wire is thicker than some, and therefore less pliable.  I found the stiff wire hoops that go over the ear unworkable - hard to emplace, didn't fit well, and worked their way out of position even when I got them on right - so I cut them off, but the E3c's stay in place better, even after the surgery.
(2)  Price, of course.

I'm happy with the performance of the E5c's, but if I had to replace them, I'd probably try a pair of custom-fit Etymotics.  They are about the same price, apparently have slightly better sound isolation, are somewhat harder to insert, maybe marginally better sound, and would only fit my ears (no battles with the family)

I bought the Shure e5c after reading some reviews, and based on using their phono cartridges for years.  There is no bass with these phone, even when I get a good ear seal.  I wrote to Shure explaing the situation and their Customer Service did not have the courtesy to respond to the message.  I then called the 800 number and just got the run around until one of the representatives stated that a new model was comming out shortly and would fix this problem.  That does not help me now and by sure I am not going to waste another $450.00 on a lousy product from Shure

If you have the means, I would highly recommend these. I was blown away by the sound. They take a little getting used to in your ears, but it's worth it. I'm a nut for high quality audio.
These won't disappoint. If your using an MP3 player,which you probably are, you do want to record your files at 192k or better. Enjoy...

Instead of gushing prosaic over how great these earphones are, I would instead like to point out a few important points.

1) You will have probably noticed that there is a very great discreptancy between reviews. Some reviewers say that these earphones sound very full with rich bass, while others claim that they are very bright and tinny. The reason for this is that these earphones rely on getting a good seal with your ear canal. One of the symptoms of having a bad seal is a very steep drop-off in bass. If they sound tinny, lean, lacking in bass, thin, metallic, etc., then it is virtually guaranteed that you do not have a good seal. In reality, these earphones do tend to favor the bass quite a bit, and have a rather soft treble.

2) The amount of sound isolation does not always equal the quality of the seal that you get. It is possible to have them in such a position where they isolate quite well, but they will still sound tinny. This is, once again, because they're not inserted correctly.

3) A good way to insert any in-ear canalphone is to pull back and outwards on your ear to open up the ear canal, then insert the earphone as deep as it will go. This can sometimes build up pressure inside your ears, and moving the canalphone to one side to temporarily break the seal and release the excess air pressure is a good idea. Once again, the sound should be warm and bassy, not thin and metallic.

4) These are high fidelity earphones. That means that feeding them 128k mp3's is not a good idea, since they will faithfully report how bad your files are. They really are at their best with lossless music, but 224k mp3's and above are a good space-saving compromise. Just don't drop below 192k. They will also show you how well or how poorly your music is recorded. A lot of modern music uses dynamic range compression in order to - theoretically, anyway - sound better on the radio. Instead, it ends up sounding much worse on high-quality equipment. With the E5c, you're at the entry point into actual hi-fi, and you will hear dynamic compression if it's there.

****

So, are these earphones worth it?

Yes, but with the impending release of the Shure E500, audiophiles will have another earphone to call top-of-the-line. The good news is that the price on the E5c should plummet when the E500 is released.

The E5c has a very warm sound which stresses the bass considerably, but remains clear and well articulated throughout the rest of the frequency spectrum. This is a very good earphone for popular music and rock. It does give up points in clarity next to the Shure E4c and Etymotic Research ER-4S, but it sounds fuller and richer than either.

An alternative to the E5c is the Westone UM2. It is a similar design with two drivers, but it has a more comfortable fit due to a different enclosure shape, and it is a bit clearer in the treble, though a bit harsher.

For the record, I've owned the E5c, E4c, Etymotic Research ER-4P and 4S, Westone UM2, and now the custom-molded Westone ES2. With every canalphone, the quality of your seal is paramount. If this is your first canalphone, then don't expect to get a good seal on your first try without being shown the proper procedure. Live with it for about a week, and eventually you will get it

What can you really say about these things...make sure you get a good seal in the ears, the correct size is needed for proper fit and comfort.  Try a few different sizes and types to see which you prefer, keep extras on hand for other people

I note Amazon has these for half of what I just threw down for them. Oh, well. I didn't know whether or not they would do what I wanted until I bought them, so I guess I just paid a heavy premium for return convenience....I'm replacing a Creative Inspire system with these, and my sense is that sound quality is better with the Logitech. Probably didn't help that the Creative center speaker stopped working. Easy set-up. Moment of panic when I got a horrible buzz from the system while listening to a test CD. Finally realized I still had the piece of plastic over the sub-woofer side vent. Listening to _Chess_ as I write this. Listening to it loud. Great, great sound! Call me a dork, but I got motivated to buy this system because I just ordered the Two Towers Complete Recordings, and I wanted to actually hear the darned center-speaker again for that. Really looking forward to that, now, with the Digital Audio

I have had these speakers for about 2 months now and they sound good. Can't say amazing but for the price, I certainly can't complain. If you spend an moderate amount of time on games and mp3s, this will be more than enough to take care of ones average needs. This is my 4th set of logitech speakers and all but 1 set has been good to me. Can't go wrong with them.

i love these speakers they are perfect for my huge computer desk there was nothing there before and now it looks awesome with my pc.  the sub is the best ever i can shake my entire house with it (my house is pretty big) and the stands for the sattelites are very sturdy despite what others have said.  it is very simple setup and goes great with any type of theme that you have going on with your computer the only thing wrong with it is that i dont have a sound card for it so i cant get the full surrond sound right now but i reccomend this to anyone who is a big gamer or loves loud music.  when you live in the middle of nowhere you can rock all night long

I purchased these speakers for $42 incl'd shipping off of eBay and hooked them up today. They sound very good, but the bass is always on. Not overbearing, but it would be nice to set it lower than the  lowest setting that is offered. The control on the sub is also very inconveniently placed in the back, next to all the wiring.
To connect the speakers to a computer, you are provided with three 1/8" jacks for front L/R, rear L/R, and the sub. However, most computers only have a 2-channel sound card, so there is only one audio output. Without an adapter, sound only goes to the front speakers and the sub. You can get an adapter at Radioshack for $6 that has a male 1/8" plug to two male RCA plugs, and then use the gaming adapter provided in the box for the speakers.
Overall, these speakers are a dramatic improvement over regular computer speakers. They look cool and have a nice sound

For my birthday, my wife took me shopping and allowed me to peruse CompUSA, Best Buy, and Wal-Mart. We saw these exact same speakers at Wal-Mart and Best Buy selling for approximately $80 to $90 before tax. In the end, my wife bought me a new Game Boy Advance that I picked out. At home, on a whim, I decided to check Amazon.com for Logitech speakers. Even after shipping, these speakers were $20 cheaper!

The shipping on these were super-fast! I ordered them on a Saturday night and they were here by Tuesday! 

Like my fellow Michigan reviewer, I used music (Korn's "Coming Undone", Rihanna's "SOS", and Godsmack's "I Stand Alone") and video games (Bethesda's "The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion) to test these speakers. While I know far less about speakers, I know that these sounded wonderful. Also, my speakers came with an adapter/converter to plug in DVD players and Video Game systems.

For the price, these are an awesome deal!

DO NOT buy these headphones. they dont fit well and have pathetic bass. for the same price you can get the stellar Sennheiser CX300-B Earbuds (amazon has them for $47 right now but i got mine for $40) which have awesome clarity, bass, and construction, and the cord wont fall apart like sony's earbud models

I can't believe anyone would review these negatively. At least no one is questioning the sound quality. In fact, they are an amazing bargain.

This is my first pair of IEMs, so I can't personally make comparisons to others, but from talking to people and reading reviews and some posts on headfi, there seems to be no question that these can easily hold their own with IEMs costing twice as much or more (at least, based on Amazon's price).

I first tried them with the flanged tips, and I have to say at that point I thought they were just OK. I switched to the foamies, and it was a whole different story. The sound is definitely very good.

Personally I find them very comfortable. I'm used to wearing earplugs, though, so maybe there was less of an adjustment for me. It's surprising that AL only has one size of foamies, but others at headfi have confirmed that replacements for the Etys (but not the regular ER6s) and Shure (not the E2) will fit these, so that should give you lots of options for fit. As far as the AL replacement parts and the website, whatever problems others might have had with those when the model first came out, they're online now. 

The isolation with the foamies is extremely, extremely good (I actually bought them specifically for use on an airplane). I would not wear them walking outside or anywhere that total isolation could be dangerous. The flanged tips don't provide as much isolation, but that may be because I can't get an ideal seal with them.

The cord is quite long. Nice if you have it plugged into your desktop, but a bit of a pain walking around with an MP3 player. There definitely are microphonics issues with the cord, but that's an issue with IEMs in general, and I'm told the 616s are better than others with this.

It is true that the case is ridiculous. I guess having a case at all is a bonus, but the thing is bigger than my 30 gig mp3 player! I guess it's OK if you're just tossing it in a backpack or something.

Overall, I can't understand why Amazon is virtually giving away this fantastic set of earphones, but I highly recommend grabbing a pair before they wise up and start charging what they're worth.

I end up returning these due to the fact that it's very uncomfortable inside your ears, and the sound quality is no better than my Ipod original earphones.

i got a new ipod nano for my birthday and HATED the stock earphones--they fit poorly and kept falling out.  i almost got the etymotic 6i in white (before the black model came out) and cancelled my order when the im616's became available.  they take some getting used to, especially when fitting correctly, and you need to make sure your ears are clean of wax.  but when they're in right, THEY SOUND FANTASTIC!  i use them in the shop working on project with power tools--all i hear is sweet music! bass response is nice too, although not overwhelming. i also sent in the coupon for the free earplugs which i got--real nice bonus! all in all, an excellent product

these headphones were a collaboration between altec lansing and etymotic. Basically, altec lansing took etymotic's technology and design and changed it slightly.

unfortunately, the change was bad. I'm comparing this to the etymotic er-6i which costs roughly eighty-five dollars at amazon. the worst part is that the part of the headphone that the earpieces attach to are at least double the diameter of the ones on the er6i. 

This wouldn't be a problem with most headphones, except these headphones are DESIGNED to be pushed deep into the ear to create the isolation and seal that the etymotic headphones are renowned for. As a result, you can feel the plastic stub (that the eartips attach to) on your ear, and that is uncomfortable.

it is like i can feel a hard plastic tube in my ear. The er-6i does not have this problem at all, since the stub is much smaller in diameter.

i returned these headphones after a couple days of trying to get used to them. I have since bought my 2nd pair of er6i and have not looked back

Quality of Phones: Sound is good if you don't mind hearing your own footsteps and every other sound that the wire captures-very poor insulation of connecting cord.
But worst of all is consumer service at AL.  My phones came with a coupon for free earplugs.  Numerous attempts to redeem it met with "try again in a few days".  I retried many times and then was told the coupon "expired".  Major dishonesty and waste of time. All email and phone calls to US based support were ignored. Phooey.  With so many good products out there, why bother with a company which is careless with its interaction with the consumer. Buy the Etymotics! I've talked with the folks there and they care about you and their product
